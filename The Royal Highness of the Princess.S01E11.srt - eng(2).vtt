00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.719
I

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.400
I just woke up.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.799
I thought it was some lecher.

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.080
You had me come to your villa.

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:17.639
You don't have another purpose, do you?

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.240
What do you think?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.439
Follow me.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.919
What exactly are you taking me to see?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.360
You had me come to your villa.

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.120
Just to keep being a pig-tending maid?

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.319
Where exactly did I offend you?

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.639
Why do you all like raising pigs so much?

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.360
Ru Feng.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.439
My lord.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.759
Take them away.

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:02.120
M-My lord...

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.919
Wasn't it you who ordered me to...

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:04.879
...search everywhere for them?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.560
Why send them away now?

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.120
My lord, there's one more thing.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.000
Speak.

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:21.080
Which guest room should I arrange for the Fifth Princess...

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.080
...to stay in?

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.039
The one closest to your bedroom...

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:25.080
...or the one farthest away?

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.919
What do you think?

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.960
I say...

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:40.280
What do you all think?

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.520
Brother.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.159
Do you think A Lan was kidnapped by the assassin?

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.360
The assassin wasn't after her.

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:53.960
Then where could she have gone?

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.800
To put it bluntly...

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.520
...it's all that He scoundrel's fault.

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:58.919
If it weren't for chasing him...

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.599
...I would never have left the Meng residence.

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:02.039
How could A Lan have gone missing?

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.919
Young Master.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.439
Young Lady.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.800
Well?

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.520
Any news?

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.719
Not yet.

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:12.520
Keep sending people to search.

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:13.879
Yes.

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:25.360
Ru Feng.

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:26.560
I saw inside the room...

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.759
...there are girl's clothes.

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:28.839
That is...

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:31.279
...that is what my lord ordered to be prepared for the princess.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.439
I didn't expect...

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:35.959
...your lord to be so considerate.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.240
I was just wondering what to wear...

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.000
...when I change and bathe later.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.000
Princess.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.920
Do you need anyone to attend to you?

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:43.879
Our villa has no maidservants.

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:44.920
No, no need.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.439
Then this subordinate will take his leave.

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:44.360
A Lan.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.480
What is it?

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:51.240
My lord.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.000
My lord, what are you...

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:03.800
You just called out 'Fifth Princess'...

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.959
What Fifth Princess?

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.279
Didn't you notice anything unusual?

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:11.160
N-No, I didn't.

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:13.639
Assassin!

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.839
There's an assassin!

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:21.560
He's already gone.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.839
In the future...

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.920
...be more alert.

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:28.160
Taking a bath in broad daylight?

00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:30.360
My lord.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.519
Young Master Meng has sent people...

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:37.319
...everywhere inquiring about the Fifth Princess's whereabouts.

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:39.399
Moreover, this subordinate also heard...

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:41.079
...that Young Master Meng particularly likes...

00:06:41.079 --> 00:06:42.279
...the Fifth Princess disguised as a maid.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.040
He often teaches her to read...

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.279
...paint, swordplay, and such.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:47.639
And the Fifth Princess...

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.240
...in turn warms Young Master Meng's bed, reads to him...

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:52.720
...and even attends his baths.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:54.680
I told you so.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.120
The Fifth Princess infiltrated the Meng residence...

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.360
...it must be for Young Master Meng.

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:00.920
He is, after all, the foremost of the Four Young Masters of Yunmi.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.240
So I say the Fifth Princess likes him...

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.000
...and wants to get close to him.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.720
That's perfectly normal, isn't it?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.600
Which room did you put the Fifth Princess in?

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:17.240
Don't worry about that, my lord.

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:18.560
I arranged her in...

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.560
...I specifically put her in the east wing room.

00:07:24.439 --> 00:07:25.160
What? My lord...

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.480
...is it still not far enough?

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:31.399
I shouldn't have saved you.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:52.160
He lifted her skull.

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:54.600
The storybooks say...

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.959
...a maid must warm the young master's bed.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.879
In a few days it will be my birthday.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:02.879
A Lan.

00:08:03.519 --> 00:08:04.759
What are you planning to give me?

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:10.800
Young Master!

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.439
You're harassing your servant!

00:08:17.519 --> 00:08:18.600
I know where the map is.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:19.720
Release the young master.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.120
I'll take you to find the map.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.000
Don't worry, Young Master.

00:08:25.079 --> 00:08:25.959
I'll be fine.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.160
Some things...

00:08:28.879 --> 00:08:30.120
...I'll explain to you later.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:00.799
Seventh Cousin.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.840
How is the wound on your arm?

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.320
It's almost healed.

00:09:13.039 --> 00:09:14.480
What's wrong? Let me see.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.519
It's nothing, nothing.

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:17.960
See?

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.120
No need to worry.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.879
Is Royal Sister almost here?

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.360
You stayed at the Meng residence for so many days...

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.440
...yet at my villa...

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.039
...you can't even stand one day?

00:09:34.799 --> 00:09:35.600
It's not the same.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.080
Indeed, it's not the same.

00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:40.279
Here, no one has you...

00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:42.799
...read, warm beds, or attend baths.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.159
A Lan.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.039
Royal Sister!

00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:50.080
Seventh Cousin!

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.200
Eldest Brother! Princess!

00:09:53.679 --> 00:09:55.519
Your servant missed you so much!

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.799
Your servant missed you so much...

00:09:56.799 --> 00:09:58.519
...I couldn't eat or drink.

00:09:58.519 --> 00:09:59.039
Really?

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:00.960
How come I feel...

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.000
...you've gained quite a bit of weight?

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.240
I did gain a few pounds.

00:10:06.159 --> 00:10:06.600
Royal Sister.

00:10:07.279 --> 00:10:08.919
Let me return to the palace with you today.

00:10:09.279 --> 00:10:11.240
When we return, if Father asks, just say...

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.720
...last night I suddenly became enlightened...

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.399
...and regained my senses.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:13.960
How about it?

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:27.840
Five hundred taels!

00:10:28.159 --> 00:10:28.720
Five hundred taels!

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:30.639
Seven hundred taels!

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:31.840
Seven hundred taels!

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.320
Is there anyone higher than seven hundred taels?

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.159
Young Master Meng

00:10:42.159 --> 00:10:42.960
Young Master Meng is here.

00:10:44.039 --> 00:10:45.240
He's so handsome and dashing.

00:10:45.279 --> 00:10:46.039
Indeed.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:49.720
Young Master Meng.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.039
Do you have something to auction?

00:10:56.399 --> 00:10:57.320
So much money!

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.759
So much, so much gold!

00:11:03.039 --> 00:11:03.679
So much gold!

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.320
Young Master Meng.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.600
What is this...

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.360
It's too much.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.600
Look, this painting is of a girl.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.039
Everyone.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.320
Today, with Prosperous Auction House as witness,

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:23.720
anyone

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.919
who finds the woman on this notice

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.200
will receive all this gold.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.519
All of it will be theirs.

00:11:29.159 --> 00:11:30.399
All of it will be theirs.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:31.720
All of it will be theirs.

00:11:31.919 --> 00:11:33.840
Young Master Meng, who is this woman?

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.919
Yes, why spend such a fortune to find her?

00:11:36.519 --> 00:11:37.840
She is a maid from my Meng household.

00:11:37.879 --> 00:11:38.480
A maid?

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.200
A person I would pay any price

00:11:40.679 --> 00:11:41.600
to find.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:42.600
Here.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.720
Give me a few, give me a few.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:44.399
Get me a few more.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.039
Give me one more.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:48.720
Give me one, give me one.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.240
There's enough for everyone.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.120
Give me one, give me one.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.720
Have you seen this woman in the painting?

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.240
I haven't seen her.

00:12:06.039 --> 00:12:07.159
Miss, have you seen her?

00:12:07.159 --> 00:12:07.639
No.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.679
Today's grapes are quite fresh.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:21.600
Here, try one.

00:12:22.679 --> 00:12:23.720
Thank you, Princess.

00:12:30.159 --> 00:12:30.720
Royal Sister.

00:12:35.159 --> 00:12:35.879
Royal Sister.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:38.639
What's wrong?

00:12:39.519 --> 00:12:41.799
Do you have something on your mind?

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.000
It's nothing.

00:12:45.919 --> 00:12:48.120
I just feel that lately,

00:12:48.879 --> 00:12:50.120
Seventh Cousin has been acting strange.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:50.960
Strange?

00:12:54.039 --> 00:12:55.000
I always feel

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.840
he's intentionally avoiding me.

00:12:58.039 --> 00:12:58.799
Fourth Princess,

00:12:59.639 --> 00:13:00.960
could it be because

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.600
Young Master Xiu has someone he likes?

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.240
Usually, when a man likes someone,

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.799
he deliberately keeps his distance from other women.

00:13:08.399 --> 00:13:09.600
According to your servant's guess,

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.759
Young Master Xiu definitely has someone in his heart.

00:13:19.519 --> 00:13:20.159
Royal Sister,

00:13:20.639 --> 00:13:22.480
you generally shouldn't listen to Xixi.

00:13:22.919 --> 00:13:24.320
You're not just any other woman.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.600
Who Seventh Cousin likes,

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.919
don't you have any sense of it at all?

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.360
You two are the male and female leads.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.440
Male and female leads?

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:32.639
What's that?

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.039
That's not important.

00:13:35.559 --> 00:13:36.120
Royal Sister,

00:13:36.639 --> 00:13:38.440
you're with Seventh Cousin every day.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.360
Haven't you noticed who he's fallen for?

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.639
Maybe we should find a way to help the leads along.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:52.519
Alright.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.240
Let's not talk about him.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:55.440
What about you?

00:13:56.159 --> 00:13:56.720
Me?

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:57.720
Yes.

00:13:59.159 --> 00:14:01.320
You still have a marriage contract with Eldest Cousin.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:03.960
The engagement will definitely be canceled.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:04.720
Besides,

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.240
Yuwen Rui doesn't want to marry me either.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.720
Come on, come on.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:13.879
Here.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:14.919
This

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.279
is fine wine I specially brought from

00:14:17.279 --> 00:14:18.440
the Drunken Immortal Tavern for Eldest Brother.

00:14:18.559 --> 00:14:18.960
Come on.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.159
Everyone, try some.

00:14:20.159 --> 00:14:21.480
Here's to us.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:21.879
Here.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:27.879
Good wine.

00:14:27.879 --> 00:14:28.720
With this mood and setting,

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.480
it's a waste not to play a game.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.360
A Lan, what do you want to play?

00:14:35.639 --> 00:14:37.679
Truth or Dare.

00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:43.320
I swear,

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.200
if I tell even half a lie,

00:14:45.679 --> 00:14:47.159
may I be run over by a carriage.

00:14:48.799 --> 00:14:49.320
Swear.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:50.519
Hurry up.

00:14:51.559 --> 00:14:52.000
This...

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.960
Seventh Cousin, hurry up.

00:15:04.399 --> 00:15:05.120
I swear,

00:15:05.679 --> 00:15:06.960
if I tell even half a lie,

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.399
may A Lan gain twenty jin.

00:15:11.159 --> 00:15:11.519
Me?!

00:15:12.519 --> 00:15:13.320
Fine, fine.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.120
If I tell even half a lie, then

00:15:15.639 --> 00:15:16.279
may I be struck by lightning.

00:15:17.279 --> 00:15:18.120
That's more like it.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:18.679
Let's go.

00:15:18.679 --> 00:15:19.240
Let's try one round first.

00:15:22.679 --> 00:15:23.720
The bamboo tube points at him.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.759
You can ask him anything.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.360
Like if he has someone he likes,

00:15:27.799 --> 00:15:28.879
what he's afraid of.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.639
If he doesn't want to answer,

00:15:30.919 --> 00:15:33.840
then he must choose a dare.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:37.200
Eldest Brother.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:38.720
Do you have someone you like?

00:15:39.559 --> 00:15:39.960
Come on, come on.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:40.600
That last one doesn't count.

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:41.879
Let's do it again.

00:15:50.559 --> 00:15:51.960
Seventh Cousin.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.200
Is there anything you want to ask?

00:16:04.799 --> 00:16:05.480
Then I'll ask.

00:16:06.519 --> 00:16:06.960
Royal Sister.

00:16:07.639 --> 00:16:09.039
What kind of man do you like?

00:16:12.159 --> 00:16:13.039
An upright and honorable man,

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.240
a man I can entrust my life to.

00:16:17.399 --> 00:16:19.639
So that's the type Royal Sister likes.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:23.639
Come on.

00:16:23.799 --> 00:16:24.200
Let's continue.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.600
Seventh Cousin.

00:16:31.919 --> 00:16:33.159
It's your turn.

00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:35.159
Then I'll ask.

00:16:36.799 --> 00:16:39.120
Do you have a woman you like?

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.720
I choose dare.

00:16:43.039 --> 00:16:43.919
A dare, huh?

00:16:45.919 --> 00:16:47.799
Then the dare is

00:16:48.159 --> 00:16:49.240
to kiss the person next to you.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.200
Seventh Cousin,

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.480
you should choose truth instead.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.119
Do you have someone you like?

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:15.680
I never expected it, Seventh Cousin.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.640
You've hidden it quite well.

00:17:18.039 --> 00:17:18.880
Come on, come on.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.359
Continue, continue. This time, it's my turn.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.480
Not me, not me.

00:17:30.319 --> 00:17:33.759
The dare is to kiss the person next to you.

00:17:36.279 --> 00:17:36.960
Me?

00:17:40.599 --> 00:17:41.480
Let me see.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.359
Seventh Cousin.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.200
Look at where the bamboo tube is pointing.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.119
It's still you.

00:17:52.799 --> 00:17:53.880
Then I'll ask another one.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.680
Is the person you like here?

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.640
A Lan, I think you're doing this on purpose.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:17:59.880
I'm not telling you.

00:18:00.599 --> 00:18:02.319
I've noticed you've been getting mischievous lately, you little fool.

00:18:02.319 --> 00:18:03.240
Isn't that right? Let me tell you.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:03.920
This is a gentleman's game.

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:04.480
You, come here.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:05.960
Come here.

00:18:06.799 --> 00:18:07.759
Have you been learning bad things?

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:08.519
Seventh Cousin!

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.480
You're still running? Let me hit you once.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.680
Royal Sister, look at him!

00:18:11.839 --> 00:18:12.240
Alright.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.039
Just once, just once.

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:14.400
Come here. Be careful.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.039
Slow down, slow down.

00:18:24.599 --> 00:18:25.880
So many?

00:18:27.599 --> 00:18:28.799
Let me see.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.960
Why are there so many 'return safely' wishes?

00:18:40.079 --> 00:18:40.960
What did you wish for?

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.160
That's my only wish right now.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:46.880
I can't tell you.

00:18:47.559 --> 00:18:50.000
You can't help me make it come true anyway.

00:18:50.519 --> 00:18:51.759
Any wish you want to come true,

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.319
I will help you achieve it.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:55.759
Really?

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.000
Then I'll only let you take a peek.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.079
Alright, alright.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.359
Are you two done yet?

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.640
Let's go, let's go.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.400
Let's keep drinking.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.599
Let's go back and keep drinking.

00:19:27.599 --> 00:19:28.559
Let's go, let's go.

00:19:30.039 --> 00:19:31.279
Let me tell you.

00:19:31.279 --> 00:19:32.240
We won't go home until we're drunk.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:33.839
Let's go.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.319
Eldest Cousin.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.839
Both you and A Lan want to cancel the engagement.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:48.279
After returning to the palace,

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.880
I will also advise Father Emperor.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.119
Once we find the person who stole the map,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.559
My engagement with her will be decided accordingly.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.359
Are you sure that with that poisoned fake map,

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:04.599
we can find the assassin?

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.279
We'll see in two days.

00:20:12.079 --> 00:20:13.720
You all should stay at the villa tonight.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:14.559
Leave tomorrow.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.279
Keep drinking.

00:20:41.839 --> 00:20:42.599
Go home.

00:20:44.079 --> 00:20:44.759
Go home.

00:20:50.119 --> 00:20:52.000
Careful, careful, careful.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:54.480
Go home.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.079
Go home.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.039
When you wake up, you can go home.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.319
Do you want to go home that badly?

00:21:15.359 --> 00:21:16.559
Want to go home.

00:21:30.599 --> 00:21:35.039
This little thing is quite a looker, huh?

00:23:15.079 --> 00:23:16.000
Get dressed and get up.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:28.680
A Zi.

00:23:30.359 --> 00:23:31.599
Last night, we...

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.400
Last night you drank too much.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.759
I was afraid you'd feel unwell if you woke up in the night,

00:23:36.319 --> 00:23:37.119
so I slept nearby.

00:23:38.119 --> 00:23:38.920
Unexpectedly, I fell asleep.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:43.480
A Zi.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:46.799
Men and women should maintain propriety.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:55.079
You're right.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.599
Now that you have a woman you like,

00:24:01.079 --> 00:24:01.720
in the future,

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:03.599
I will be more careful.

00:24:18.039 --> 00:24:19.759
Who is the woman Seventh Cousin likes?

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:24.240
Have I met her?

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:28.160
No.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.079
How did Yuwen Rui get into my bed?

00:26:11.079 --> 00:26:12.920
He really is quite handsome.

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:22.200
Fifth Princess.

00:26:26.279 --> 00:26:28.119
Doesn't this count as taking advantage of someone?

00:26:30.759 --> 00:26:31.359
I wiped it for you.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:32.880
Don't mind it.

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.880
What were you trying to do while I was asleep?

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.759
You moved, that's why I fell.

00:26:50.279 --> 00:26:51.640
You weren't doing it on purpose, were you?

00:26:52.759 --> 00:26:53.400
On purpose?

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.160
I deliberately let you fall on me to attack me?

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:58.079
For what purpose?

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:00.720
That's true.

00:27:01.799 --> 00:27:03.680
Since the Fifth Princess has been so forward with me,

00:27:04.359 --> 00:27:05.839
I can only respond in kind.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.440
Return the favor.

00:27:09.519 --> 00:27:10.240
What are you doing?

00:27:30.359 --> 00:27:31.680
I'm not like you.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.240
I don't enjoy taking liberties with others.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.400
Consider yourself lucky this time.

00:27:55.039 --> 00:27:55.440
Eldest Brother.

00:27:55.759 --> 00:27:56.720
Then I'll escort them back first.

00:27:57.039 --> 00:27:58.039
I'll come find you again in a few days.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.000
Seventh Cousin!

00:27:59.200 --> 00:27:59.920
Hurry up!

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:00.519
Everyone's waiting for you.

00:28:00.519 --> 00:28:01.039
Coming, coming!

00:28:01.519 --> 00:28:02.000
We're leaving.

00:28:17.599 --> 00:28:18.119
Royal Sister.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.480
What's wrong?

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.480
Seventh Cousin really does have someone he likes.

00:28:29.319 --> 00:28:30.880
It's probably someone none of us know.

00:28:31.759 --> 00:28:32.680
Impossible.

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:34.640
He said it himself.

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.039
He must be lying.

00:28:38.799 --> 00:28:39.759
I didn't expect...

00:28:40.799 --> 00:28:42.759
that I would care about this so much.

00:28:49.119 --> 00:28:49.559
My lord.

00:28:51.119 --> 00:28:52.759
The Fifth Princess didn't even have breakfast.

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:54.160
She was in such a hurry to leave.

00:28:54.599 --> 00:28:55.319
It seems...

00:28:55.319 --> 00:28:57.200
she's unwilling to stay at this villa a moment longer.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.240
I can see it now.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.160
The Fifth Princess truly does not like you.

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:02.359
This villa...

00:29:02.599 --> 00:29:03.759
she probably won't come back to again.

00:29:08.039 --> 00:29:09.799
If she ever willingly returns in the future,

00:29:09.839 --> 00:29:10.640
what will you do?

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:11.799
That's absolutely impossible.

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:12.960
If the Fifth Princess does come back,

00:29:13.079 --> 00:29:14.039
according to Shadow Guard rules,

00:29:14.279 --> 00:29:14.839
if I lose the bet,

00:29:15.079 --> 00:29:16.119
I'll wear women's clothing.

00:29:25.279 --> 00:29:25.839
Fi...

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:37.440
Fifth Princess!

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:38.920
What are you...?

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:42.839
Please sit tight and hold on.

00:29:43.759 --> 00:29:46.240
This Plot Spirit is about to issue a new mission.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.799
The... the mountain road is rough.

00:29:50.119 --> 00:29:50.920
Royal Sister, sit more securely.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.079
Listen carefully.

00:29:55.599 --> 00:29:57.440
The next cannon fodder you need to save

00:29:57.799 --> 00:29:58.519
is...

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:00.799
Ru Feng.

00:30:05.559 --> 00:30:06.200
Stop the carriage!

00:30:16.079 --> 00:30:17.599
I've thought it over carefully.

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.000
Staying at this villa

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.720
is much more interesting than being in the palace.

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:21.599
Right?

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.920
Remember what you said.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.319
My lord.

00:30:56.319 --> 00:30:57.440
Princess.

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.880
Princess, you are so beautiful.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:08.839
Xixi.

00:31:10.599 --> 00:31:12.559
You... don't misunderstand.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:13.839
I lost a bet with my lord.

00:31:13.839 --> 00:31:14.400
No need to say more.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:16.559
I understand everything.

00:31:18.799 --> 00:31:19.720
What do you understand?

00:31:28.079 --> 00:31:30.400
Some things don't need to be spelled out.

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:31.640
Yes.

00:31:32.519 --> 00:31:33.400
This dress is new.

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.079
This is life's trial for us.

00:31:40.559 --> 00:31:41.480
It will pass eventually.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:48.839
Don't be sad.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.400
You wearing this...

00:31:57.079 --> 00:31:58.079
actually looks quite good.

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:10.720
I'm saying, next time...

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:11.920
when you give me a new mission...

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.720
can you pick the right moment?

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.000
I just got on the carriage away from Yuwen Rui.

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:17.079
Then you tell me the next...

00:32:17.079 --> 00:32:18.640
person to save is Ru Feng.

00:32:19.519 --> 00:32:20.880
Are you teaching me how to do my job?

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:22.920
Fine.

00:32:23.839 --> 00:32:24.400
Tell me.

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.000
In the original plot...

00:32:26.559 --> 00:32:27.400
where does Ru Feng die?

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:28.279
How does he die?

00:32:28.759 --> 00:32:30.519
Right in the woods at the foot of this mountain.

00:32:31.519 --> 00:32:32.720
As for when he dies...

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.599
due to the increased mission difficulty...

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:37.079
you will not know.

00:32:37.079 --> 00:32:38.559
when the cannon fodder meets his end.

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:43.119
Mission difficulty increased.

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:45.440
You don't even discuss it with me?

00:32:46.599 --> 00:32:47.599
What do you think?

00:32:52.079 --> 00:32:53.839
What about Yuwen Rui?

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:54.839
What?

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:56.119
Are you worried about him?

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.200
Why would I worry about him?

00:32:59.119 --> 00:33:00.240
I'm just thinking...

00:33:00.759 --> 00:33:01.759
Ru Feng's death...

00:33:02.119 --> 00:33:03.680
might be related to Yuwen Rui.

00:33:04.079 --> 00:33:05.319
If Yuwen Rui gave Ru Feng...

00:33:05.319 --> 00:33:06.240
some mission...

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.400
and sent Ru Feng to carry it out...

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:08.240
And then...

00:33:08.839 --> 00:33:09.920
Don't try to trick me into talking again.

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.599
This Plot Spirit won't fall for your trap again.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:15.799
This attitude of yours won't do.

00:33:16.319 --> 00:33:17.640
Between a human and a Plot Spirit...

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.039
wouldn't a little more trust be good?

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.680
Cross-dimensional trust is fragile.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:23.240
Goodbye.

00:33:24.519 --> 00:33:25.160
Good luck.

00:33:29.559 --> 00:33:30.119
I say...

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:33.880
Again with this.

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:40.359
Princess.

00:33:42.359 --> 00:33:44.079
How much longer must we stay...

00:33:44.079 --> 00:33:45.119
at Lord Yuwen's villa?

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:45.960
What's wrong?

00:33:46.279 --> 00:33:47.400
You want to leave as soon as we arrive?

00:33:48.839 --> 00:33:50.480
Your servant is worried about you.

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:54.640
I think Lord Yuwen is very strange.

00:33:55.559 --> 00:33:56.200
Strange?

00:33:57.839 --> 00:33:59.279
Guess what I just saw.

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:00.880
What did you see?

00:34:02.519 --> 00:34:03.519
I saw Ru Feng...

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.799
actually practicing swordplay in women's clothing.

00:34:06.519 --> 00:34:08.280
The skirt was even pink.

00:34:09.039 --> 00:34:10.679
Why... why would he?

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.079
Ru Feng was evasive...

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.119
and unwilling to say more.

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.440
But your servant understood everything at a glance.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.960
Many young masters from noble families...

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:23.719
have some strange quirks.

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.880
Like forbidding maids to laugh.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:30.199
Not letting their wives appear in public.

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:32.360
Or, for example...

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:36.320
forcing their subordinates to dress as women.

00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:40.639
So you mean Yuwen Rui is...

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:43.599
Lord Yuwen is the last kind.

00:34:46.039 --> 00:34:47.440
After all this time apart...

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:49.679
you still have that familiar train of thought.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:51.400
Princess.

00:34:52.039 --> 00:34:54.079
Your servant notices Lord Yuwen these past few days...

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.800
seems quite eager for you to stay at the villa.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.679
Could it be he regrets it...

00:34:58.679 --> 00:34:59.800
and wants to marry you again?

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:01.519
No.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.280
That's good then.

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:05.800
He made you so sad before.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.679
Now that you've finally come to your senses...

00:35:08.639 --> 00:35:09.960
your servant doesn't want to see...

00:35:10.159 --> 00:35:11.639
him make you sad again.

00:35:13.599 --> 00:35:14.320
Princess.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.960
Now that everyone knows your mind has recovered...

00:35:17.039 --> 00:35:18.480
your marriage arrangement with Lord Yuwen...

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.119
won't it be difficult to cancel?

00:35:20.519 --> 00:35:21.079
Don't worry.

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.599
I will not marry him.

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:28.519
Princess.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:29.800
Didn't you say...

00:35:30.119 --> 00:35:30.880
these past days...

00:35:31.119 --> 00:35:32.440
you've been staying at the Meng residence?

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:35.079
So, what is Young Master Meng like?

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.800
He's talented in both arts and war, and fiercely protective of his own.

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:44.079
Why?

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:45.960
It's nothing.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:48.840
Young Master Meng...

00:35:49.519 --> 00:35:50.199
and the Fifth Princess...

00:35:51.599 --> 00:35:52.679
are a perfect match.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.159
I wonder if that heartless little black one...

00:35:58.159 --> 00:35:59.039
misses me or not.

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:06.119
Let's take A Lan's portrait and ask around.

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.519
Maybe someone has seen her.

00:36:09.599 --> 00:36:10.320
Lord He.

00:36:11.519 --> 00:36:12.079
Miss Meng.

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:14.800
Lord He, your visit to the Meng residence...

00:36:16.039 --> 00:36:17.639
His Majesty ordered me to investigate the matter of the assassin.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:20.599
Lord He.

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.559
A maid from my residence is missing.

00:36:22.679 --> 00:36:24.000
She may have been abducted by the assassin.

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:26.000
Could you investigate this for me, my lord?

00:36:26.519 --> 00:36:27.039
This is her.

00:36:27.199 --> 00:36:27.800
Her name is A Lan.

00:36:33.519 --> 00:36:36.119
I will inform you as soon as I have any news.

00:36:38.519 --> 00:36:39.159
Miss Meng.

00:36:40.159 --> 00:36:42.440
There is something I would like...

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:43.960
On my brother's birthday...

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.320
It's all because of that petty thief I left the Meng residence.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.880
Otherwise, how could A Lan have gone missing?

00:36:51.079 --> 00:36:51.599
My lord.

00:36:52.199 --> 00:36:54.440
He is likely part of the same group as the assassin.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.199
Once I catch that petty thief named He...

00:36:57.679 --> 00:37:00.199
this young lady will definitely tear him to pieces!

00:37:07.039 --> 00:37:08.880
My lord, you just said you had something for me?

00:37:16.599 --> 00:37:17.199
Lord He

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:20.000
Do you think this petty thief looks like you?

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:27.280
They do seem somewhat similar.

00:37:28.559 --> 00:37:29.920
Look more carefully.

00:37:30.199 --> 00:37:31.199
How could they be alike?

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:34.840
Lord He has distinct brows and eyes.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.239
This thief has a pointy face and beady eyes.

00:37:38.559 --> 00:37:39.880
He looks dishonest at first glance.

00:37:41.119 --> 00:37:42.480
How can he compare to you?

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:43.679
Don't you agree?

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.159
Miss Meng.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:48.800
I have urgent business to attend to.

00:37:49.639 --> 00:37:50.400
I must take my leave now.

00:37:59.559 --> 00:38:00.159
Let's go.

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:03.360
Young Master.

00:38:03.719 --> 00:38:05.199
I ordered an investigation into A Lan's whereabouts.

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:06.480
We discovered something strange.

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:07.679
Speak.

00:38:08.639 --> 00:38:10.159
A clerk from the tailor shop in the next alley

00:38:10.599 --> 00:38:12.039
said that two days before your birthday,

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:15.280
he accidentally saw the Grand Chancellor and A Lan

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.199
talking by the back door.

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:18.119
But he was too far away

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.199
to hear what they said.

00:38:22.039 --> 00:38:24.280
Investigate the relationship between A Lan and Yuwen Rui.

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:25.719
Yes.
