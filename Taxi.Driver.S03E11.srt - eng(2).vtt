It's ten dollars each!

All right, we've got two large ones on the block!

00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:04.775
- It's 15 dollars. And 3 dollars. - Medium-sized.

Tuna, small-sized.

00:01:09.415 --> 00:01:11.214
It's 45 dollars to bidder 15!

When I get involved, you jerks are all dead meat.

00:03:40.295 --> 00:03:43.065
Gosh, you shouldn't sneak up on people like that.

00:03:43.805 --> 00:03:46.735
I was waiting for you to finish.

00:03:47.235 --> 00:03:49.335
I wasn't talking to anyone. I was just thinking out loud.

00:03:49.535 --> 00:03:52.075
He listens to your thoughts well too.

00:03:53.245 --> 00:03:54.245
Who is?

00:03:55.575 --> 00:03:59.615
The one in the seat next to you. He's been with you this whole time.

00:04:01.385 --> 00:04:02.485
You mean...

00:04:03.515 --> 00:04:04.555
there's someone here?

00:04:05.455 --> 00:04:09.355
The Almighty is always by your side.

00:04:10.355 --> 00:04:11.995
Gosh, what's wrong with you?

00:04:13.265 --> 00:04:14.865
There's something I need to tell you.

00:04:17.705 --> 00:04:20.005
Okay, let me get this straight.

00:04:20.575 --> 00:04:23.945
You have a younger sister, Da Som, who was adopted.

00:04:24.005 --> 00:04:25.245
Her name is Park Da Som.

00:04:25.705 --> 00:04:28.815
Right. Your sister, Park Da Som,

00:04:28.875 --> 00:04:32.315
used a resale app to buy a 98-dollar gift for her dad.

00:04:32.385 --> 00:04:34.284
It was leather gloves,

00:04:34.285 --> 00:04:36.455
- but what she got was a brick. - Yes.

00:04:39.485 --> 00:04:42.055
Gosh, her dad was seriously injured.

00:04:42.655 --> 00:04:46.765
She said he had multiple surgeries after a car accident.

00:04:48.265 --> 00:04:49.495
How old is Da Som?

00:04:49.995 --> 00:04:51.265
She's eight.

00:04:51.635 --> 00:04:53.805
She became part of the family two years ago.

00:04:54.675 --> 00:04:56.634
It couldn't have been easy for an eight-year-old...

00:04:56.635 --> 00:04:57.975
to save up 98 dollars.

00:04:58.075 --> 00:04:59.905
She saved up the allowance...

00:05:00.305 --> 00:05:03.985
her dad gave her for over a year to buy them.

00:05:05.585 --> 00:05:06.585
Okay.

00:05:07.045 --> 00:05:09.385
That 98 dollars that Da Som saved up.

00:05:09.785 --> 00:05:11.255
I'll just round it up to 100 dollars and give it to her.

00:05:14.195 --> 00:05:15.625
No, you can't do that.

00:05:16.495 --> 00:05:17.565
Why not?

00:05:18.465 --> 00:05:20.765
I can just give her 100 dollars to buy a new pair of gloves.

00:05:21.065 --> 00:05:23.235
But that wouldn't be Da Som's money.

00:05:24.005 --> 00:05:26.505
Da Som said she wanted to use her own money...

00:05:26.565 --> 00:05:29.535
to buy the gloves for her dad.

00:05:29.935 --> 00:05:30.975
It's not the same.

00:05:31.245 --> 00:05:33.815
- Maria. - Da Som.

00:05:34.775 --> 00:05:37.815
I'm here with the man I told you about.

00:05:38.485 --> 00:05:40.385
Hello, Mr. Hero.

00:05:40.985 --> 00:05:41.985
What?

00:05:42.085 --> 00:05:46.655
Maria told me she has a hero who protects her.

00:05:48.295 --> 00:05:49.555
Oh, boy.

00:05:52.695 --> 00:05:53.795
But...

00:05:55.935 --> 00:05:57.605
about my dad's gloves...

00:05:58.265 --> 00:05:59.965
Can you find them for me?

00:06:03.845 --> 00:06:06.345
Those 98-dollar gloves that you bought.

00:06:06.945 --> 00:06:09.675
- I'll find them for you. - Really?

00:06:10.215 --> 00:06:12.885
Can you just tell me exactly where you bought them and from whom?

00:06:14.315 --> 00:06:15.415
Driver Seo.

00:06:16.015 --> 00:06:19.585
The parts will arrive this evening. I'll call when the work's done.

00:06:19.655 --> 00:06:22.995
It's oil change day, so I'm swamped and my head is spinning.

00:06:23.055 --> 00:06:25.725
Jin Eon is busy until tonight.

00:06:25.865 --> 00:06:26.965
Chief Park.

00:06:27.395 --> 00:06:29.594
I have to go out to renew my insurance.

00:06:29.595 --> 00:06:30.965
Can you cover the office for a bit?

00:06:31.665 --> 00:06:33.205
And Go Eun's heading out.

00:06:33.265 --> 00:06:35.675
I'm swamped. Why don't you call Driver Kim?

00:06:35.735 --> 00:06:38.675
I can't. He drove all night and just got in.

00:06:38.745 --> 00:06:40.145
I think he just fell asleep.

00:06:41.245 --> 00:06:42.415
Right.

00:06:42.845 --> 00:06:44.815
You can't wake someone up after a long haul like that.

00:06:44.845 --> 00:06:46.745
Fine, I'll go ask Mr. Jang.

00:06:47.415 --> 00:06:48.685
Gosh.

00:06:50.385 --> 00:06:52.025
Looks like it's up to me.

00:06:54.195 --> 00:06:55.195
Gosh, it's hot!

00:06:55.755 --> 00:07:00.395

(Deluxe Taxi)

00:07:12.905 --> 00:07:15.645
For tricking Da Som, who isn't even ten,

00:07:15.945 --> 00:07:18.585
and stealing 98 dollars from her.

00:07:18.645 --> 00:07:20.915
(Deluxe Taxi)

00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:25.825
That's not a crime I can take lightly.

00:07:27.555 --> 00:07:29.325
(Deluxe Taxi)

00:07:30.055 --> 00:07:31.165

00:07:31.825 --> 00:07:33.125

(Rainbow Transport)

00:07:43.005 --> 00:07:44.705
I can't go. I can't see anything.

00:07:46.005 --> 00:07:47.205
Stop. Goodness.

00:07:47.345 --> 00:07:49.275
(Rainbow Transport)

00:07:55.115 --> 00:07:57.185
Stop spraying that. I can't breathe.

00:07:59.525 --> 00:08:06.425
(One week later)

00:08:07.065 --> 00:08:09.765
To get this film on right, there can't be even a speck of dust.

00:08:10.705 --> 00:08:14.705
I'm already wiping it so hard the glass is about to disappear.

00:08:15.175 --> 00:08:16.175
Go Eun.

00:08:17.135 --> 00:08:18.305
There's still a wet spot on the side.

00:08:19.445 --> 00:08:22.015
- Here? - No, not there. Next to it.

00:08:22.615 --> 00:08:24.145
- Here? - Next to that.

00:08:24.215 --> 00:08:25.615
- Here? - Next to that.

00:08:25.685 --> 00:08:28.355
- Where "next to that"? I'm done. - No,

00:08:28.985 --> 00:08:30.685
I mean here. Right here.

00:08:32.025 --> 00:08:34.095
Let's just do it when Chief Choi gets back.

00:08:34.155 --> 00:08:37.495
No way. I promised Driver Seo I'd finish it by today.

00:08:37.565 --> 00:08:41.465
Where on earth did Chief Choi go? He's not answering calls or texts.

00:08:44.135 --> 00:08:45.535
Are you not done yet?

00:08:45.965 --> 00:08:47.005
No.

00:08:48.235 --> 00:08:49.675
It's taking forever since I'm doing it by myself.

00:08:50.375 --> 00:08:53.075
"By myself"? I've helped you so much my arms are about to fall off.

00:08:54.945 --> 00:08:58.085
- Any word from Chief Choi yet? - No.

00:08:58.515 --> 00:09:01.185
Should I ask Mr. Jang if he's heard from him?

00:09:01.285 --> 00:09:02.915
I already asked him this morning.

00:09:03.255 --> 00:09:06.425
He said he'd take a few days off, but he's not answering his phone.

00:09:06.485 --> 00:09:09.455
He must be on one heck of a vacation if he can't answer his phone.

00:09:10.255 --> 00:09:12.495
You don't think he went abroad, do you?

00:09:12.825 --> 00:09:15.365
He took the Deluxe Taxi, so he must be in the country.

00:09:15.435 --> 00:09:16.994
He's making us all worry sick.

00:09:16.995 --> 00:09:18.365
Just you wait until you get back.

00:09:21.775 --> 00:09:24.875
- Would you buy me a coffee? - Sure.

00:09:25.475 --> 00:09:27.415
- You want one too, Chief Park? - No, I'm good.

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:32.315
Guess I have to finish this myself.

00:09:56.535 --> 00:09:57.545
Jin Eon.

00:09:57.945 --> 00:09:58.945
Gyeong Gu!

00:10:00.475 --> 00:10:03.615
- Have you been okay? - I tried calling you so many times.

00:10:03.845 --> 00:10:05.045
What happened? You look terrible.

00:10:07.485 --> 00:10:10.255
Gyeong Gu, where have you been and what have you been doing?

00:10:12.355 --> 00:10:14.755
- My 5,000 dollars. - What?

00:10:15.095 --> 00:10:16.125
Five thousand dollars?

00:10:21.495 --> 00:10:23.435
Chief Choi, come on and sit down.

00:10:23.795 --> 00:10:25.135
What are you doing over there by yourself?

00:10:25.465 --> 00:10:28.075
Yes. Why are you lurking over there like you committed a crime?

00:10:29.475 --> 00:10:30.535
No, I'm fine.

00:10:31.245 --> 00:10:33.345
I'll just stay here. I'm more comfortable.

00:10:35.545 --> 00:10:38.415
Get over here and sit down while I'm still asking nicely.

00:10:41.015 --> 00:10:43.255
That's our Go Eun, always so sweet with her words.

00:10:46.785 --> 00:10:50.695
So, what Da Som tried to buy was a pair of gloves, right?

00:10:50.925 --> 00:10:54.535
Yes. They're worth a whopping 200 dollars new,

00:10:55.295 --> 00:10:57.605
but it was listed for 98 dollars because it had been "tried on once."

00:10:58.235 --> 00:11:01.505
Even so, isn't that a bit pricey for a kid?

00:11:02.075 --> 00:11:04.375
Her dad's in the hospital after an accident,

00:11:04.645 --> 00:11:06.675
and the doctor told them to keep his hands and feet warm.

00:11:07.275 --> 00:11:10.145
So Da Som took her entire life savings...

00:11:10.375 --> 00:11:14.255
and used it to buy the best gloves she could find on a resale app.

00:11:15.115 --> 00:11:18.025
Darn it. Of all the people to scam, they go after a kid.

00:11:18.055 --> 00:11:19.725
Those jerks. Just wait until I get my hands on them.

00:11:19.885 --> 00:11:22.355
Why didn't you just give 98 dollars to Da Som?

00:11:22.495 --> 00:11:23.595
Hey.

00:11:23.855 --> 00:11:25.295
That wouldn't be Da Som's money.

00:11:29.135 --> 00:11:30.195
What's the difference?

00:11:31.065 --> 00:11:34.105
I can't really explain it. But it's different.

00:11:34.835 --> 00:11:38.505
But how in the world did you go from trying to get back 98 dollars...

00:11:38.575 --> 00:11:40.445
to getting scammed out of 5,000 dollars?

00:11:40.575 --> 00:11:43.815
That's what I'm saying! How does that even happen?

00:11:44.215 --> 00:11:45.345
Well, here's what happened.

00:11:46.645 --> 00:11:49.385
I almost had that jerk.

00:11:51.285 --> 00:11:53.755
I went on the resale app Da Som told me about,

00:11:53.825 --> 00:11:56.195
and the scam listing was still brazenly posted.

00:11:57.195 --> 00:11:59.425
Wait! There it is.

00:11:59.825 --> 00:12:01.895
- Username, Fishing King. - Username, Fishing King.

00:12:02.765 --> 00:12:04.865
The username was Fishing Master before.

00:12:05.465 --> 00:12:07.905
And that name just annoys me even more. This scum.

00:12:08.575 --> 00:12:10.375
He's in the same neighbourhood too.

00:12:11.575 --> 00:12:13.105
This guy's got some nerve.

00:12:14.475 --> 00:12:16.945
Anyway, I have him now.

00:12:17.915 --> 00:12:20.215
"I want to buy a cell phone."

00:12:20.785 --> 00:12:23.055
"I'd like to meet in person."

00:12:24.185 --> 00:12:27.125
My plan is to pretend to be a buyer and set up an in-person meeting.

00:12:27.155 --> 00:12:30.094
And when he shows up, I'd nab him.

00:12:30.095 --> 00:12:31.325
What do you think?

00:12:36.135 --> 00:12:39.505
My mistake was sending cash first to gain his trust.

00:12:41.635 --> 00:12:43.035
He ghosted me the second he got the money.

00:12:43.705 --> 00:12:44.945
Did you report the listing?

00:12:45.475 --> 00:12:46.645
I did,

00:12:46.945 --> 00:12:48.945
but he just posted it again under a different username.

00:12:51.285 --> 00:12:55.815
But I don't think any phone would cost 5,000 dollars, would it?

00:12:56.055 --> 00:12:57.055
Right.

00:12:57.655 --> 00:13:00.185
- Of course not. - But you said you lost 5,000.

00:13:02.855 --> 00:13:05.125
"I want to buy a bicycle."

00:13:05.965 --> 00:13:10.195
"Since it's expensive, I want to meet in person."

00:13:11.735 --> 00:13:15.335
It's too much money for him to pass up. He'll definitely show.

00:13:16.775 --> 00:13:18.005
And that's when...

00:13:18.875 --> 00:13:20.805
- I'd nab him. - Nab him.

00:13:27.345 --> 00:13:29.954
It was a mistake to agree to giving him...

00:13:29.955 --> 00:13:31.485
half of the deposit to put him at ease.

00:13:32.885 --> 00:13:36.595
Darn it. He ghosted me after getting just half of it.

00:13:37.255 --> 00:13:40.465
- Did you go to the police station? - For Da Som's case or mine?

00:13:40.525 --> 00:13:43.495
- Come on. - Well... Both.

00:13:43.795 --> 00:13:48.635
I reported the account number that Da Som sent money to.

00:13:49.205 --> 00:13:51.845
But the officer said it'd be hard to catch him anytime soon.

00:13:52.075 --> 00:13:53.445
They wouldn't even investigate? Why not?

00:13:53.605 --> 00:13:57.885
Even if you report that account, it's bound to be a mule account,

00:13:58.415 --> 00:14:00.415
and even if the police file to have it frozen,

00:14:00.485 --> 00:14:03.055
the money will have already been transferred overseas.

00:14:03.755 --> 00:14:06.255
That's why these online crimes are so hard to track.

00:14:06.555 --> 00:14:08.955
Just like with that voice phishing case.

00:14:09.195 --> 00:14:10.895
Yes, that's exactly what he said.

00:14:11.065 --> 00:14:14.025
But you got scammed once before. How could you...

00:14:14.095 --> 00:14:16.265
It felt like he was right there in front of me!

00:14:16.335 --> 00:14:19.965
Nab him? You lost 5,000 dollars without even getting a glimpse.

00:14:20.005 --> 00:14:22.875
We were texting back and forth, and we even talked on the phone.

00:14:23.475 --> 00:14:26.305
I thought I could just reach out and grab him.

00:14:27.815 --> 00:14:32.085
So I guess we'll get your money back with Da Som's, Chief Choi.

00:14:32.815 --> 00:14:35.455
I guess we have to. The man who went for Da Som's money...

00:14:35.515 --> 00:14:37.215
basically became Park Da Som. What are you going to do?

00:14:40.155 --> 00:14:41.155
Thanks, guys.

00:14:41.525 --> 00:14:46.025
Can you get me the tracking number from the brick package Da Som got?

00:14:46.225 --> 00:14:48.635
Yes, I took photos of it.

00:14:48.765 --> 00:14:50.765
Good job, our little Da Som. Good job.

00:14:52.465 --> 00:14:54.335
Once we look up the tracking number,

00:14:54.405 --> 00:14:56.335
we can find the sender's address.

00:14:56.505 --> 00:14:57.845
I'll go check it out.

00:14:59.075 --> 00:15:01.345
It was that simple all along.

00:15:01.945 --> 00:15:03.515
You guys are amazing, as always.

00:15:05.015 --> 00:15:06.015
Gosh.

00:15:11.555 --> 00:15:12.625
Goodness.

00:15:13.155 --> 00:15:15.155
You didn't have to come. This isn't for work.

00:15:15.955 --> 00:15:18.825
Anytime you take the taxi out, it's a job for all of us.

00:15:19.295 --> 00:15:21.095
I'm just going to get my stolen money back, that's all.

00:15:22.095 --> 00:15:26.235
With all the grief he's given us, I don't even want to help him.

00:15:26.505 --> 00:15:28.505
Just thinking about that jerk still makes me shake with rage.

00:15:28.575 --> 00:15:31.035
I'd rather re-enlist in the army, you know?

00:15:31.475 --> 00:15:35.675
For Chief Choi, it was never about the 98 dollars.

00:15:36.275 --> 00:15:38.915
It was about Da Som's feelings behind it.

00:15:39.615 --> 00:15:41.715
Yes, that's Chief Choi for you.

00:15:42.215 --> 00:15:44.855
He just drives you crazy sometimes.

00:15:49.525 --> 00:15:51.725
- Let's go. - All right.

00:15:52.465 --> 00:15:53.994
This is so frustrating!

00:15:53.995 --> 00:15:55.295
(Safety First)

00:15:55.435 --> 00:15:57.265
So, what should I do? Should I wash the car or something?

00:15:57.535 --> 00:15:59.905
- I'll make it spotless. - Wash yourself, not the car!

00:15:59.965 --> 00:16:02.135
- Me? Clean? - Yes, you! Go clean yourself up!

00:16:09.515 --> 00:16:10.875
Looks like it's the first floor of this building.

00:16:11.485 --> 00:16:12.515
That was quick.

00:16:26.095 --> 00:16:27.095
Hello? Anyone home?

00:16:28.665 --> 00:16:29.665
Is anybody here?

00:16:31.305 --> 00:16:32.405
I guess no one's home.

00:16:32.965 --> 00:16:34.405
We found the place, but...

00:16:35.005 --> 00:16:36.675
Why? Is something wrong?

00:16:42.915 --> 00:16:44.645
Driver Kim, get out of there!

00:16:48.415 --> 00:16:49.455
Stay back.

00:16:59.025 --> 00:17:01.295
Hey! Can you hear me?

00:17:02.095 --> 00:17:03.095
Are you okay?

00:17:04.835 --> 00:17:05.835
Go Eun!

00:17:08.935 --> 00:17:11.375
- Ma'am? Are you with us? I... - Yes.

00:17:13.275 --> 00:17:14.875
- Get her on my back. - Okay.

00:17:19.615 --> 00:17:20.615
One second.

00:17:43.935 --> 00:17:44.975
Are you also here...

00:17:46.045 --> 00:17:48.145
to get your money back?

00:17:50.045 --> 00:17:51.045
What am I going to do?

00:17:52.415 --> 00:17:53.845
I have nothing to give you.

00:17:55.015 --> 00:17:56.815
You're right, I did come to get my money back.

00:18:00.355 --> 00:18:02.655
But you don't seem like the person...

00:18:03.525 --> 00:18:05.165
I should be demanding it from.

00:18:17.375 --> 00:18:18.575
You're a victim in this too,

00:18:19.545 --> 00:18:20.705
aren't you?

00:18:29.515 --> 00:18:30.855
I'm sorry.

00:18:32.885 --> 00:18:33.955
I'm so sorry.

00:18:35.655 --> 00:18:39.725
It's just, everyone around me blames me for this.

00:18:40.425 --> 00:18:42.465
I'm sorry for misunderstanding.

00:18:44.365 --> 00:18:45.405
Ms. Yoo Min Jung.

00:18:47.605 --> 00:18:49.535
Can you tell me...

00:18:51.305 --> 00:18:53.175
what has happened to you?

00:19:04.485 --> 00:19:07.885
Oh, my. Little one, your things are so expensive.

00:19:08.525 --> 00:19:10.355
I didn't realise having a baby would be this expensive.

00:19:10.555 --> 00:19:14.095
I had quit my job, so we were living on just my husband's salary.

00:19:15.665 --> 00:19:18.435
So I wanted to save even a little bit on our expenses.

00:19:18.505 --> 00:19:20.104
(Baby Supplies: Crib, stroller, car seat)

00:19:20.105 --> 00:19:22.075
(It was a gift, but it's too small for my baby, so I'm selling it.)

00:19:22.335 --> 00:19:24.075
(Woori Hyunjoo Mom, For safety, use our chat and Secure Pay)

00:19:24.335 --> 00:19:25.375
This looks good.

00:19:26.005 --> 00:19:28.615
Hi, if these are still available, I'd like to buy the whole lot.

00:19:28.675 --> 00:19:30.445
(If these are still available, I'd like to buy the whole lot)

00:19:30.515 --> 00:19:33.785
Please... Cross your fingers for me, okay?

00:19:34.715 --> 00:19:37.085
- I hope it comes this week. - Please send your account number.

00:19:37.155 --> 00:19:39.524
Ms. Yoo Min Jung, we're ready for you.

00:19:39.525 --> 00:19:41.595
- Okay. - I just sent the payment.

00:19:41.655 --> 00:19:42.725
(Payment sent)

00:19:43.695 --> 00:19:44.695
Be careful.

00:19:48.165 --> 00:19:50.635
A few days later, a package arrived.

00:19:59.705 --> 00:20:02.545
And now, it's time for the unboxing.

00:20:03.275 --> 00:20:07.685
Do you know how much thought Mommy put into choosing all this?

00:20:18.995 --> 00:20:20.465
What is this?

00:20:26.705 --> 00:20:28.275
Just pick up the phone!

00:20:30.835 --> 00:20:32.775
(4: Tracking number and photo of package contents)

00:20:32.945 --> 00:20:33.945
The items...

00:20:33.975 --> 00:20:35.845
The user ID from the secondhand marketplace app,

00:20:36.045 --> 00:20:38.045
account, and tracking number.

00:20:38.385 --> 00:20:41.415
I submitted all of it as evidence, including the phone number.

00:20:42.085 --> 00:20:44.055
But it all traced back to different people.

00:20:45.025 --> 00:20:48.395
On top of that, the phone was a burner.

00:20:48.795 --> 00:20:50.995
Looks like this is a burner phone.

00:20:52.595 --> 00:20:54.225
If you just go home and wait,

00:20:54.295 --> 00:20:56.735
we'll contact you as soon as we have an update.

00:20:56.795 --> 00:20:58.735
Do you know when that might be?

00:20:59.005 --> 00:21:01.635
When? Well...

00:21:02.075 --> 00:21:04.175
We have to request the app's cooperation,

00:21:04.235 --> 00:21:06.275
and then wait for them to get back to us.

00:21:06.345 --> 00:21:09.145
It's hard to give you an exact time frame.

00:21:12.315 --> 00:21:14.045
What's for lunch? Spicy pork or pork cutlets?

00:21:14.115 --> 00:21:16.115
- Soup and rice today. - Excuse me...

00:21:17.415 --> 00:21:18.925
Will you even contact me at all?

00:21:19.055 --> 00:21:22.595
Contact you? Yes, of course we will.

00:21:23.425 --> 00:21:25.025
I know you're upset,

00:21:25.095 --> 00:21:27.465
but in cases like this, don't get your hopes up and wait.

00:21:27.525 --> 00:21:29.595
That might be better for you.

00:21:30.695 --> 00:21:32.135
Why soup and rice again?

00:21:45.345 --> 00:21:47.145
If the police weren't going to do anything,

00:21:47.785 --> 00:21:50.055
I decided I'd have to fight that jerk my own way.

00:21:51.015 --> 00:21:52.725
I was too furious to just sit back and do nothing.

00:21:53.885 --> 00:21:55.824
Posting my story of being scammed.

00:21:55.825 --> 00:21:59.025
Everyone, please be careful. I hope you get what's coming to you.

00:21:59.595 --> 00:22:03.635
I tracked down every post made with his user ID and reported them.

00:22:03.695 --> 00:22:06.665
He posted another one. This post is a scam.

00:22:07.065 --> 00:22:09.435
Don't buy anything from this person. Seriously.

00:22:11.135 --> 00:22:12.175
That's when...

00:22:13.105 --> 00:22:14.705
I got a call from that jerk.

00:22:14.915 --> 00:22:16.045
Hello?

00:22:16.775 --> 00:22:19.215
- We haven't been introduced. - What?

00:22:20.215 --> 00:22:21.245
Who is this?

00:22:22.355 --> 00:22:24.985
I'll let what's about to happen serve as my introduction.

00:22:26.055 --> 00:22:27.525
Let's change your phone first.

00:22:28.195 --> 00:22:29.225
Hello?

00:22:30.195 --> 00:22:31.225
Are you there?

00:22:33.895 --> 00:22:34.965
What was that about?

00:22:36.265 --> 00:22:37.265
A free giveaway?

00:22:39.565 --> 00:22:41.105
From that moment on,

00:22:41.675 --> 00:22:44.235
he started tormenting me in these bizarre ways.

00:22:49.815 --> 00:22:50.815
Hello...

00:22:51.075 --> 00:22:52.844
(Is the free bike still available?)

00:22:52.845 --> 00:22:54.915
I'm not the one giving away a bike.

00:22:54.985 --> 00:22:56.315
(Saw your post about the free item. Still available?)

00:22:56.385 --> 00:22:57.585
(I'm interested in the stroller.)

00:22:57.655 --> 00:22:58.755
(Giving away an air purifier?)

00:22:59.255 --> 00:23:00.325
(Hi, about the stroller you posted...)

00:23:00.385 --> 00:23:01.425
Hello?

(Is it still available?)

00:23:03.295 --> 00:23:05.565
I told you, I didn't post that!

00:23:05.625 --> 00:23:07.125
(Please let me know if it's still available.)

00:23:07.195 --> 00:23:08.535

(If the dresser's free, I can come now.)

00:23:09.665 --> 00:23:11.165
Why do I keep getting these?

00:23:11.235 --> 00:23:12.365
(Me! I want it.)

00:23:12.435 --> 00:23:13.505
(If the stroller's available, I'll take it!)

00:23:13.565 --> 00:23:16.775
I was getting calls and texts from strangers day and night,

00:23:16.835 --> 00:23:18.075
(If it's not gone yet, I'd like to have it.)

00:23:18.135 --> 00:23:20.075
so it was impossible to lead a normal life.

00:23:21.505 --> 00:23:23.545
You're all set up. You can start using it right away.

00:23:23.615 --> 00:23:25.045
Okay, thank you.

00:23:26.315 --> 00:23:28.185
You're all set. Thank you.

00:23:31.385 --> 00:23:33.625
(New Plans, Number Porting, Phone Upgrades)

00:23:34.185 --> 00:23:35.225
This is good.

00:24:09.425 --> 00:24:11.025
- What is this? - You ordered jokbal, right?

00:24:11.095 --> 00:24:12.095
No, I didn't order anything.

00:24:12.165 --> 00:24:13.865
Look, right here. Isn't this your number?

00:24:14.365 --> 00:24:16.335
I said I didn't order it. You have the wrong place.

00:24:16.435 --> 00:24:17.595
Hey, you owe me 49 dollars for the jokbal.

00:24:17.665 --> 00:24:18.765
Look, I'm closing the door.

00:24:18.835 --> 00:24:21.635
Maybe someone else here ordered it. I'm in a hurry. Just pay me, please.

00:24:21.705 --> 00:24:22.905
Sorry, but like I said, I didn't order it.

00:24:22.975 --> 00:24:23.975
- It's the right address! - I'm closing the door.

00:24:24.035 --> 00:24:25.545
Don't put that down.

00:24:25.605 --> 00:24:27.675
- Excuse me. - Just give me the 49 dollars.

00:24:32.985 --> 00:24:33.985
Excuse me!

00:24:35.955 --> 00:24:38.015
- Hello? Anyone home? - Who is it?

00:24:39.285 --> 00:24:40.525
Please open the door.

00:24:40.885 --> 00:24:41.995
Yes? Who is it?

00:24:43.125 --> 00:24:44.755
- This will only take a second. - What?

00:24:44.825 --> 00:24:46.865
- I've got you now, you wench. - Who are you?

00:24:46.925 --> 00:24:50.465
You thought you could steal from me? You scamming wench!

00:24:50.565 --> 00:24:52.235
Scam you? What are you talking about?

00:24:52.635 --> 00:24:54.665
- Give me my money back, you wench! - Who are you?

00:24:54.735 --> 00:24:56.675
- Please, give me my money back! - Who are you?

00:24:56.735 --> 00:24:58.745
Everyone! There's a con artist living here!

00:24:59.005 --> 00:25:03.445
Please, someone call the police! Everyone! There's a scammer in here!

00:25:03.515 --> 00:25:07.385
You wench! Give me my darn money! Please! Give it back to me!

00:25:07.445 --> 00:25:10.955
Everyone, please someone call the police!

00:25:11.015 --> 00:25:12.585
Help me with this scammer...

00:25:13.385 --> 00:25:14.955
I'm a victim here too!

00:25:15.355 --> 00:25:19.825
They have my address and my number, so they're using them for this scam.

00:25:19.895 --> 00:25:21.465
- How do I know you're not in on it? - Ma'am, that's enough.

00:25:21.525 --> 00:25:23.265
- How should I know, you wench? - Ma'am, that's enough.

00:25:23.995 --> 00:25:26.865
- Please, just come to my apartment. - First, you need to calm down.

00:25:27.135 --> 00:25:29.275
Please, I just need you to come to my apartment.

00:25:29.335 --> 00:25:30.635
Stop lying, you wench!

00:25:30.705 --> 00:25:32.445
(Concerned Citizen, Con artist, Everyone, be careful.)

00:25:32.505 --> 00:25:33.605
On the app,

00:25:35.015 --> 00:25:37.215
they'd turned me into a con artist before I knew it.

00:25:38.345 --> 00:25:39.785
My picture, my home address,

00:25:39.845 --> 00:25:41.085
(Got nothing better to do than scam kids?)

00:25:41.145 --> 00:25:43.185
and even my phone number were all posted online.

00:25:43.255 --> 00:25:44.455
(Get a life, you jerk.)

00:25:44.515 --> 00:25:45.785
(Have you no conscience, taking people's money?)

00:25:45.855 --> 00:25:47.085
(Give my money back or I'll hunt you for life.)

00:25:47.155 --> 00:25:48.355
(Weren't you raised right? I'll kill you.)

00:25:48.425 --> 00:25:49.495
(You scamming wench, I'll catch you.)

00:25:49.555 --> 00:25:50.625
(What a scary world.)

00:25:53.365 --> 00:25:54.365
No, sir.

00:25:54.695 --> 00:25:56.465
Of course not. I would never do a thing like that.

00:25:57.135 --> 00:25:58.965
I am so sorry. Yes, sir.

00:26:09.615 --> 00:26:10.675
Hey, Yoo Min Jung.

00:26:11.215 --> 00:26:12.215
What is this?

00:26:14.185 --> 00:26:16.455
- It's not what it looks like... - Come on. Not you too?

00:26:22.255 --> 00:26:25.065
You need to think about the baby.

00:26:27.295 --> 00:26:28.795
Just listen to me.

00:26:30.165 --> 00:26:31.165
Please?

00:26:32.165 --> 00:26:34.765
Hello, sir. I just got off work.

00:26:35.005 --> 00:26:36.075
The file? Now?

00:26:36.405 --> 00:26:39.105
No, not a problem. I'll send it over right away. Yes, thank you.

00:26:40.245 --> 00:26:41.545
Seriously...

00:26:47.715 --> 00:26:49.815
- Everything looks good. - Thank you.

00:26:49.955 --> 00:26:51.955
- We'll see you next week. - Okay, thank you.

00:26:52.025 --> 00:26:54.525
- Can you help her finish up? - Of course, I'll clean you up.

00:26:54.585 --> 00:26:55.755
Okay, thank you.

00:26:56.395 --> 00:26:58.665
- Come out when you're ready. - Thank you.

00:26:59.895 --> 00:27:00.925
Hello?

00:27:01.195 --> 00:27:04.995
- It's me, Ms. Yoo Min Jung. - What?

00:27:05.835 --> 00:27:06.835
Hello?

00:27:08.705 --> 00:27:10.235
How did you get my number?

00:27:10.605 --> 00:27:12.075
How do you think?

00:27:14.145 --> 00:27:15.945
I got it the day after you activated it.

00:27:17.015 --> 00:27:18.175
Want to see something even more fun?

00:27:25.785 --> 00:27:27.655
Hey, wait.

00:27:28.955 --> 00:27:30.155
Hey, hello?

00:27:31.525 --> 00:27:32.525
Hello?

00:27:54.645 --> 00:27:55.655
Hello?

00:27:56.655 --> 00:27:57.715
Detective.

00:27:59.125 --> 00:28:00.525
That jerk is here.

00:28:02.555 --> 00:28:04.255
This isn't something I can discuss over the phone.

00:28:05.125 --> 00:28:06.225
Could you come down to the station?

00:28:06.965 --> 00:28:07.965
Okay.

00:28:11.465 --> 00:28:13.834
- Yes, please come in. - I think I'm being blackmailed.

00:28:13.835 --> 00:28:15.475
He just sent me this.

00:28:15.535 --> 00:28:16.535
Right, I see that.

00:28:17.335 --> 00:28:18.975
The thing is, a report was filed.

00:28:19.405 --> 00:28:20.405
A report?

00:28:20.475 --> 00:28:23.415
We've received several fraud reports involving your bank account.

00:28:23.775 --> 00:28:26.215
- Have a seat. - You're accusing me of fraud?

00:28:26.285 --> 00:28:27.285
Yes.

00:28:27.915 --> 00:28:30.555
Now, could you start by filling this out, please?

00:28:31.055 --> 00:28:34.755
How is this fair? I'm the victim here.

00:28:35.695 --> 00:28:37.755
That jerk is the one who sent me this!

00:28:37.825 --> 00:28:39.195
First, please calm down.

00:28:39.395 --> 00:28:42.135
Oh, that jerk knows my account number.

00:28:42.295 --> 00:28:44.694
I gave him my account for a refund.

00:28:44.695 --> 00:28:46.065
- Now he's using it for this! - Okay.

00:28:46.165 --> 00:28:49.705
Look, regardless of the amount, money was deposited in your account.

00:28:49.775 --> 00:28:52.175
So you'll have to be investigated. My hands are tied.

00:28:52.275 --> 00:28:54.745
But you know I'm the victim.

00:28:54.805 --> 00:28:57.875
Look, I get it. Just please fill out the statement form first.

00:28:58.415 --> 00:29:01.015
Gosh, she's so darn mouthy.

00:29:01.515 --> 00:29:03.855
- I'm the victim here! - Okay.

00:29:03.915 --> 00:29:06.655
- How annoying. - The more I pleaded my innocence,

00:29:07.485 --> 00:29:09.225
the more hopeless everything felt.

00:29:09.825 --> 00:29:12.225
Your name and national ID number here.

00:29:19.635 --> 00:29:22.535
In the end, I moved to get away from that jerk.

00:29:25.105 --> 00:29:26.105
Honey.

00:29:59.945 --> 00:30:00.975
Hello?

00:30:01.845 --> 00:30:03.445
So, how's the new place?

00:30:07.585 --> 00:30:10.585
Come on, why act so surprised?

00:30:12.385 --> 00:30:14.185
I'm recording your voice right now.

00:30:15.995 --> 00:30:17.895
I'm reporting you to the police for making threats.

00:30:19.525 --> 00:30:20.525
Goodness.

00:30:21.095 --> 00:30:24.035
She still hasn't learned her lesson after all that.

00:30:24.865 --> 00:30:27.265
Did the cops do anything to protect you?

00:30:27.665 --> 00:30:29.975
- Hey! - The cops...

00:30:30.575 --> 00:30:31.575
can't catch me.

00:30:32.375 --> 00:30:34.705
But me? I can get to you.

00:30:35.815 --> 00:30:38.375
Whenever I feel like it.

00:30:38.945 --> 00:30:41.145
Anytime.

00:30:51.625 --> 00:30:53.295
Hello? Chicken delivery!

00:30:56.395 --> 00:30:58.195
- Chicken delivery! - Hey...

00:30:58.665 --> 00:30:59.904
- I didn't know what you'd like, - Hello?

00:30:59.905 --> 00:31:01.005
So I ordered half-and-half.

00:31:01.535 --> 00:31:02.535
Is that okay?

00:31:04.475 --> 00:31:06.945
- It was all my fault. - Sounds like someone's in there.

00:31:07.905 --> 00:31:11.115
- I'll drop all the charges. - Hello? Delivery!

00:31:11.815 --> 00:31:14.515
(Acorn Market, Yoo Min Jung)

00:31:14.785 --> 00:31:16.055
I just sent you an account number.

00:31:16.915 --> 00:31:19.955
Send 30,000 dollars to this account, and I'll accept your apology.

00:31:22.655 --> 00:31:24.995
I was wrong.

00:31:25.795 --> 00:31:28.365
- I'll never do it again. - Excuse me. Delivery!

00:31:28.795 --> 00:31:31.795
- I don't have any money. - How about jokbal for a snack?

00:31:38.205 --> 00:31:39.474
Gosh, stop your whining.

00:31:39.475 --> 00:31:41.375
- You're too old for this. - I'm sorry!

00:31:41.445 --> 00:31:43.975
- Please! I'm sorry! - Please open the door!

00:31:44.375 --> 00:31:47.015
- Anyone home? - Hello! Open the door!

00:31:48.215 --> 00:31:52.455
- Hello? It's a delivery! - Hey! Ma'am!

00:31:52.525 --> 00:31:55.455
- Hey! Please open the door! - Come on, open the door!

00:31:55.525 --> 00:31:57.395
- Come on. - Hey, come on!

00:31:57.455 --> 00:31:59.495
- I said it's a delivery! - Delivery!

00:31:59.595 --> 00:32:01.695
- Nobody's home. - Man, this delivery...

00:32:02.265 --> 00:32:04.135
- Hey, what on earth? - Hey, your jokbal!

00:32:05.295 --> 00:32:06.805
Hey, can't you hear us?

00:32:07.265 --> 00:32:10.005
- Oh, it opened. She's coming out. - You were in there the whole time?

00:32:10.075 --> 00:32:13.545
Why didn't you open the door? We've all been waiting.

00:32:13.605 --> 00:32:15.745
- We need you to pay. The payment. - We're just making a delivery.

00:32:15.815 --> 00:32:17.475
- Please pay for this. The payment. - Please hurry up and pay.

00:32:17.545 --> 00:32:19.445
- Please pay. - What are you doing?

00:32:19.515 --> 00:32:21.215
- Just pay us already! - We have to go.

00:32:21.285 --> 00:32:24.155
- You came out, so take your food. - Hey, we said you need to pay! Now!

00:32:25.155 --> 00:32:27.185
- Is that blood? - Gosh, what is this?

00:32:27.255 --> 00:32:29.754
- Are you okay? Ma'am. - What's wrong?

00:32:29.755 --> 00:32:31.125
- There's blood. - Are you okay?

00:32:31.195 --> 00:32:32.825
- Ma'am? - Are you okay?

00:32:34.295 --> 00:32:36.435
- Ma'am, are you all right? - Are you okay?

00:32:36.495 --> 00:32:37.495
Gosh, what is this?

00:32:37.565 --> 00:32:39.835
Oh, my gosh, she's bleeding so much. Ma'am! What do we do?

00:32:41.065 --> 00:32:42.065
Are you okay?

00:32:42.875 --> 00:32:44.075
Ma'am, are you okay?

00:32:44.535 --> 00:32:47.505
- Hey! Someone call 911! - Ma'am, stay with us!

00:32:47.575 --> 00:32:49.045
Ma'am, are you okay?

00:32:49.175 --> 00:32:50.715
(Petition)

00:32:50.815 --> 00:32:54.845
The user ID is under a fake name, The phone and account are burners.

00:32:55.315 --> 00:32:57.915
Nothing is actually in his name. It's all fake.

00:32:58.315 --> 00:32:59.425
There is one thing that's real.

00:33:00.855 --> 00:33:01.855
And what's that?

00:33:02.795 --> 00:33:03.795
Voice.

00:33:09.635 --> 00:33:11.495
I'm recording your voice right now.

00:33:11.835 --> 00:33:13.765
I'm reporting you to the police for making threats.

00:33:14.035 --> 00:33:16.905
She still hasn't learned her lesson after all that.

00:33:16.975 --> 00:33:19.345
Did the cops do anything to protect you?

00:33:19.675 --> 00:33:22.875
- Hey! - The cops can't catch me.

00:33:23.345 --> 00:33:25.815
But me? I can get to you.

00:33:26.415 --> 00:33:28.715
Whenever I feel like it.

00:33:29.315 --> 00:33:31.455
Anytime.

00:33:32.925 --> 00:33:36.225
From the way he talks, he's sure he'll never be caught.

00:33:36.725 --> 00:33:38.625
Meaning, this isn't the first time he's done this.

00:33:39.995 --> 00:33:41.065
Also,

00:33:42.865 --> 00:33:45.535
that package Ms. Yoo Min Jung received...

00:33:47.365 --> 00:33:50.135
The more I look at it, the more it gets under my skin.

00:33:50.335 --> 00:33:52.445
"You Took the Bait"?

00:33:52.805 --> 00:33:56.175
His nicknames are about fishing too. God, this jerk is infuriating.

00:33:56.245 --> 00:33:59.215
What an arrogant jerk. Seriously, how do we catch him?

00:34:00.545 --> 00:34:02.485
We'll start by finding the guy who took the photos.

00:34:02.785 --> 00:34:06.455
The photos? The ones taken at the OB-GYN clinic?

00:34:07.125 --> 00:34:08.125
Yes.

00:34:13.695 --> 00:34:16.165
How's it looking? Is this the right spot?

00:34:17.035 --> 00:34:18.035
You think this is it?

00:34:22.375 --> 00:34:25.235
If this was taken on a cell phone, the quality wouldn't be this good.

00:34:26.105 --> 00:34:29.275
With a high-angle shot like this...

00:34:29.645 --> 00:34:31.945
I think Driver Kim was right. It must've been taken from here.

00:34:39.085 --> 00:34:41.654
- Go Eun. - "I need CCTV of all entering..."

00:34:41.655 --> 00:34:43.855
"or leaving the building opposite..."

00:34:43.925 --> 00:34:46.495
"when Yoo Min Jung went into the clinic."

00:34:46.765 --> 00:34:47.965
That's what you were going to ask, right?

00:34:50.235 --> 00:34:51.235
Yes.

00:34:51.295 --> 00:34:54.204
There wasn't much foot traffic, and it was right after lunch,

00:34:54.205 --> 00:34:57.305
so hardly anyone was going in or out. I'll find him in no time.

00:35:01.445 --> 00:35:03.344
Would you look at that? He even has a camera bag.

00:35:03.345 --> 00:35:05.245
He took photos with a telephoto lens.

00:35:05.815 --> 00:35:06.815
You already found him?

00:35:07.285 --> 00:35:10.115
I'll find out where you can meet him in just a second.

00:35:18.725 --> 00:35:21.865
He went so far as to hire a private detective agency...

00:35:22.195 --> 00:35:24.095
to take a picture of the victim?

00:35:24.435 --> 00:35:27.165
To him, it was probably an effective way to blackmail her.

00:35:27.605 --> 00:35:30.405
Most victims probably got scared and gave up after seeing the pics.

There's something I need to find out.

Finding things out is what we do best.

00:36:02.335 --> 00:36:03.505
Come on over and have a seat.

00:36:13.815 --> 00:36:15.655
- Thank you. - Yes, sure.

00:36:16.585 --> 00:36:19.655
Personal problems, worries you can't tell anyone else,

00:36:20.225 --> 00:36:22.955
when you've only got a gut feeling and no real proof,

00:36:23.025 --> 00:36:25.965
and you lack time or the know-how to handle it yourself.

00:36:26.965 --> 00:36:28.725
That's when our skilled staff...

00:36:29.095 --> 00:36:33.105
can responsibly gather evidence and catch them in the act...

All right, now it's your turn.

What is it you'd like us to find out?

00:37:01.165 --> 00:37:04.935
- We're pros at paternity tests. - It looks like...

00:37:05.265 --> 00:37:06.535
this photo was taken by your staff.

00:37:09.335 --> 00:37:11.635
I need to see the information on your client.

00:37:14.645 --> 00:37:17.115
- Are you a cop? - Hardly.

00:37:20.245 --> 00:37:21.945
If you're not a cop, then pretty soon,

00:37:23.355 --> 00:37:25.725
you're going to be in a whole lot of trouble.

00:37:25.955 --> 00:37:28.325
Me? Or you?

00:37:30.925 --> 00:37:32.355

- You think I'm in trouble? Hey! - Yes!

00:37:45.035 --> 00:37:46.045
Hang on a minute.

00:37:51.315 --> 00:37:53.685
I don't want to cause a scene.

00:37:54.285 --> 00:37:56.315
And I'd rather not damage any of your property.

Is the coffee to your liking, sir?

00:38:33.285 --> 00:38:35.925
Who made this coffee?

00:38:36.695 --> 00:38:37.855
I did.

00:38:40.225 --> 00:38:41.665
It's just that...

00:38:42.535 --> 00:38:45.665
we have a policy of not disclosing any information about our clients.

00:38:46.465 --> 00:38:48.865
That's just the way...

00:38:49.505 --> 00:38:50.505
Well...

00:38:50.506 --> 00:38:52.035
(We even find the location of the moon's reflection floating on lake.)

00:38:52.105 --> 00:38:54.405
Look, the request was just made over the phone,

00:38:54.475 --> 00:38:56.215
and all we did was send them the picture we took.

00:38:57.715 --> 00:38:58.715
That's it.

00:39:04.055 --> 00:39:07.555
So you're saying the one who hired the private detective...

00:39:07.955 --> 00:39:09.755
was Chief Choi.

00:39:10.295 --> 00:39:14.295
I'm telling you, I didn't hire them! I'm being framed!

00:39:14.595 --> 00:39:18.465
They randomly used the identities of people they'd scammed.

00:39:18.735 --> 00:39:21.705
But something still feels off.

00:39:22.365 --> 00:39:25.075
Why go to the trouble of hiring private investigators...

00:39:25.135 --> 00:39:27.575
just to harass Ms. Yoo Min Jung like this?

00:39:27.645 --> 00:39:30.945
The retaliation against Ms. Yoo from the beginning...

00:39:31.015 --> 00:39:33.045
seems to be a mix of two different M.O.s.

00:39:33.515 --> 00:39:35.345
One is meticulous and timid,

00:39:35.785 --> 00:39:37.285
like a diligent, low-level con artist.

00:39:38.155 --> 00:39:39.825
The other is bold, cruel,

00:39:40.885 --> 00:39:43.455
and enjoys playing sadistic games.

00:39:44.825 --> 00:39:47.195
And this situation feels more like the latter.

00:39:48.265 --> 00:39:52.765
So like you said, it's not one guy, but a whole group?

00:39:54.865 --> 00:39:56.805
It's clear they're organised.

00:39:59.705 --> 00:40:01.175
I have to be honest. At first,

00:40:01.575 --> 00:40:05.315
I was frustrated, wondering how people still fall for them.

00:40:06.585 --> 00:40:08.145
But now I can see how it could happen.

00:40:08.585 --> 00:40:11.384
It drives you absolutely crazy when you're watching.

00:40:11.385 --> 00:40:13.485
It's not like they're a ghost.

00:40:13.555 --> 00:40:15.084
They text me and call me.

00:40:15.085 --> 00:40:17.555
If I just push a little harder, I could catch them.

00:40:17.625 --> 00:40:19.625
But I just can't catch them.

00:40:22.125 --> 00:40:25.395
I have an idea.

00:40:27.065 --> 00:40:28.065
An idea?

00:40:29.065 --> 00:40:30.135
Do you want to give it a shot?

00:40:31.605 --> 00:40:34.905
They're using a private network and routing through overseas IPs,

00:40:34.975 --> 00:40:38.145
so it's hard to track them. Chasing them just makes them run.

00:40:38.215 --> 00:40:42.185
So instead of chasing them, we need to make them come to us.

00:40:42.385 --> 00:40:45.215
I'd love for them to come to us. But how?

00:40:46.355 --> 00:40:49.125
From now on, is everyone ready to do exactly as I say?

00:40:50.355 --> 00:40:53.565

No, you must sound more desperate than that, Mr. Jang.

What's with "seeking to purchase"? This is an Elements' concert!

00:41:05.675 --> 00:41:07.875
- All right. - Try, "I'm dyiiing to buy tickets!"

00:41:07.945 --> 00:41:09.345
- Pwease. - Get them for me, pwease.

- Pwease. - That's it.

00:41:10.615 --> 00:41:12.615
- Pretty pwease. - Pwease.

00:41:12.685 --> 00:41:13.945
- That's it. - And then, what was next?

00:41:14.015 --> 00:41:16.185
- The crying emojis. - Right, and the crying emojis.

00:41:16.255 --> 00:41:18.315
- Gosh, you're a natural. - Okay.

00:41:18.385 --> 00:41:22.325

- I'm looking for... - Just keep posting.

00:41:41.445 --> 00:41:44.515
We need to make it seem like these tickets are super popular...

00:41:44.645 --> 00:41:47.885
and that they're impossible to find. Keep posting to create that feeling.

00:41:47.945 --> 00:41:50.815
Don't forget the crying emoji. You're all doing great. That's it.

00:41:50.885 --> 00:41:51.885

Perfect!

Now, Driver Kim Do Gi, post that you're buying tickets.

- That's the jerk. - How do you know this is our guy?

00:43:31.885 --> 00:43:35.025
This resale app requires you to verify your location.

00:43:35.385 --> 00:43:37.325
And when you do, it leaves behind GPS data like this.

00:43:37.655 --> 00:43:41.495
And as you can see, the GPS of Ms. Yoo's scammer...

00:43:41.665 --> 00:43:44.195
- is a near-perfect match, right? - I see.

00:43:44.565 --> 00:43:47.265
- He's a creature of habit. - So we just raid the place and...

00:43:47.335 --> 00:43:51.235
Come on. You think he'd use his own address?

00:43:53.545 --> 00:43:55.575

(Can you show me proof you have the physical tickets?)

00:44:13.065 --> 00:44:16.665
To give you proof, he'll have to buy one physical ticket himself.

00:44:18.635 --> 00:44:22.135
Since he's buying a real ticket, he probably won't think twice.

00:44:26.275 --> 00:44:27.675
And then, it's game over.

00:44:28.905 --> 00:44:29.915
But...

00:44:30.545 --> 00:44:35.215
many people must be buying tickets. How do we single out the scammer?

00:44:35.415 --> 00:44:38.985
Why bother singling him out? That's too much work.

00:44:39.155 --> 00:44:40.525
If we don't, then what?

00:44:40.655 --> 00:44:43.025
Elements is still in the middle of recording their album,

00:44:43.095 --> 00:44:44.495

That's our Elements manager.

00:44:47.695 --> 00:44:50.194
I see. If the concert's fake,

00:44:50.195 --> 00:44:51.635
the whole website is fake too?

Yes!
