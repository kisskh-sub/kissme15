Did you lie to me?

00:01:25.916 --> 00:01:28.197
I didn't lie...

00:01:29.591 --> 00:01:31.838

I was trying to find the right moment...

Were you ever going to tell me?

00:01:50.432 --> 00:01:52.008
Or were you just going to keep lying?

00:01:52.008 --> 00:01:54.578
If I were trying to hide it,
I wouldn't say it now.

00:01:54.578 --> 00:01:57.195
So you're saying it was just bad timing?

That's not what I mean--

00:01:58.715 --> 00:02:00.741
Then what do you mean?

00:02:00.741 --> 00:02:02.958
Are you saying you don't have a kid?

00:02:09.555 --> 00:02:11.821
Did I look that easy to you?

00:02:13.436 --> 00:02:15.404
Did you think I was so lonely

00:02:15.404 --> 00:02:18.717
that you having a kid wouldn't matter to me?

Any criminal record?

I was afraid you'd react like this.

That's why I couldn't tell you.

I was scared.

Because I really liked you...

How do you think that makes me feel?

00:03:03.645 --> 00:03:04.890
I hate myself for liking you.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.743

00:15:29.201 --> 00:15:30.948
Hold on a second.

00:15:36.153 --> 00:15:38.453
- Dad?
- Hi, Jun Seo.

00:15:38.453 --> 00:15:40.855
I felt bad leaving without seeing you,

00:15:40.855 --> 00:15:43.893
but hearing your voice like this
makes me feel better.

00:15:45.442 --> 00:15:47.569
- Dad.
- Yeah?

00:15:51.643 --> 00:15:53.449
I'm sorry about what happened before.

00:15:54.223 --> 00:15:56.035
Have a good trip.

00:16:05.144 --> 00:16:08.578
We don't want to ruin his day. Right?

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:16.909
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

00:16:16.909 --> 00:16:19.748
They call just to check in,
even when nothing's wrong.

00:16:19.748 --> 00:16:22.281
It's usually parents who worry like that.

00:16:22.281 --> 00:16:24.695
Now that they're grown,
they're the ones worrying about me.

00:16:24.695 --> 00:16:26.955
Sounds like your children turned out well.

00:16:26.955 --> 00:16:28.701
They did.

00:16:28.701 --> 00:16:30.761
My daughter is an OB-GYN,

00:16:30.761 --> 00:16:32.861
and my son is in grad school.

00:16:32.861 --> 00:16:34.967
They are so nice.

00:16:34.967 --> 00:16:36.212
You must be proud.

00:16:36.212 --> 00:16:38.021
But it's not that simple.

00:16:38.021 --> 00:16:40.280
My son still hasn't found
what he truly loves to do,

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.494
and that worries me.

00:16:42.494 --> 00:16:44.367
And my daughter hasn't found
someone she loves yet,

00:16:44.367 --> 00:16:46.400
that worries me too.

00:16:49.535 --> 00:16:51.474
When did we take that picture?

00:16:52.794 --> 00:16:55.155
Was it the year you started college?

00:16:55.155 --> 00:16:57.528
It was my orientation day.

00:17:00.708 --> 00:17:03.155
A few months before Mom's accident.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.887
It feels so awkward.

00:17:08.061 --> 00:17:10.520
Why were we smiling like that?

00:18:11.666 --> 00:18:13.406
You...

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:19.414
You look good.

00:18:22.874 --> 00:18:24.587
Honey?

00:18:27.141 --> 00:18:30.194
You know... thinking back,

00:18:30.194 --> 00:18:34.194
our family wasn't that happy
even before Mom's accident.

00:18:35.527 --> 00:18:38.040
But we weren't unhappy either.

00:18:41.935 --> 00:18:43.575
Do you think so?

00:18:45.975 --> 00:18:47.588
Right.

00:18:47.588 --> 00:18:49.368
We were just... ordinary.

00:18:50.868 --> 00:18:52.458
We...

00:18:57.788 --> 00:18:59.561
No, I...

00:19:01.732 --> 00:19:05.365
I think I blamed Mom for my unhappiness.

00:19:06.321 --> 00:19:08.340
It was just my fault.

00:19:14.114 --> 00:19:17.335
Geez, the power is out again.

00:19:17.335 --> 00:19:19.177
- Hey.
- Yeah?

00:19:21.515 --> 00:19:24.715
Do you think this ever happened
when Mom was alone?

00:19:48.031 --> 00:19:50.127
She must've been scared.

00:19:51.459 --> 00:19:53.698
Yeah.

00:19:53.698 --> 00:19:55.671
Probably lonely, too.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:05.804
Honey.

00:20:05.804 --> 00:20:08.017
Why are you sitting in the dark?

00:20:13.318 --> 00:20:15.691
Oh, the power is out.

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:23.215
There.

00:20:23.215 --> 00:20:25.390
It's bright now.

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:28.823
Next time the lights go out, over there...

00:20:34.464 --> 00:20:35.922
Honey.

00:20:38.263 --> 00:20:39.365
I'm sorry.

00:20:39.365 --> 00:20:42.031
I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry.

00:20:44.287 --> 00:20:46.161
Don't cry.

00:20:48.227 --> 00:20:50.367
You were scared, weren't you?

00:20:51.561 --> 00:20:52.935
I'm so sorry.

00:20:52.935 --> 00:20:54.655
I'm sorry I came home late.

00:20:54.655 --> 00:20:56.541
Honey, don't cry.

00:21:18.301 --> 00:21:21.080
It wasn't too late.

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:22.865
I always had you

00:21:22.865 --> 00:21:25.335
right by my side.

00:21:25.335 --> 00:21:28.675
That's why I felt sorry every day,

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:32.981
and grateful every day.

00:21:32.981 --> 00:21:36.021
- Honey.
- Don't cry.

00:21:36.021 --> 00:21:38.714
Everyone is waiting for you outside.

00:21:42.121 --> 00:21:44.161
You...

00:21:44.161 --> 00:21:46.414
You look amazing today.

00:21:46.414 --> 00:21:47.814
Huh?

00:21:48.654 --> 00:21:52.541
That woman, Ja Yeong.

00:21:52.541 --> 00:21:54.675
She's pretty.

00:21:54.675 --> 00:21:56.767
She looks good with you.

00:21:57.495 --> 00:22:00.574
Don't say that.

00:22:00.574 --> 00:22:04.734
Don't hesitate anymore. Don't hold back.

00:22:05.935 --> 00:22:07.575
You should

00:22:08.394 --> 00:22:11.268
think about yourself,

00:22:11.268 --> 00:22:14.075
and live for yourself.

00:22:14.801 --> 00:22:19.741
I want you to be truly happy.

00:22:19.741 --> 00:22:21.488
Okay.

00:22:21.488 --> 00:22:24.655
Every single day...

00:22:24.655 --> 00:22:26.321
be happy.

00:22:28.995 --> 00:22:31.187
Honey.

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:34.188
Honey.

00:22:34.188 --> 00:22:36.115
Honey.

00:22:36.115 --> 00:22:38.790
Honey.

00:22:40.451 --> 00:22:42.517
Honey.

00:23:07.173 --> 00:23:08.363
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

00:23:08.363 --> 00:23:12.665
Is there a tall, slim middle-aged man inside?

00:23:12.665 --> 00:23:14.286
There's no one here.

00:23:20.398 --> 00:23:22.144
Mr. Seo Jin Ho?

00:23:26.052 --> 00:23:27.538
Mr. Seo Jin Ho?

00:23:30.418 --> 00:23:31.924
Mr. Seo?

00:23:56.447 --> 00:23:58.643
What are you doing here?

00:24:01.141 --> 00:24:03.141
Did something happen?

00:24:08.458 --> 00:24:10.951
You probably wouldn't understand

00:24:11.625 --> 00:24:13.658
why I'm like this.

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:19.593
I feel like I'm the only one living well,

00:24:21.357 --> 00:24:23.637
and that makes me feel so guilty.

00:24:25.644 --> 00:24:27.570
It hurts so much.

00:24:28.165 --> 00:24:31.258
It would be stranger
if you didn't feel that way.

00:24:32.931 --> 00:24:34.402
No.

00:24:36.309 --> 00:24:38.702
You've already gotten through it.

00:24:38.702 --> 00:24:41.232
Someone weak like me...

00:24:41.232 --> 00:24:43.165
these feelings...

00:24:44.411 --> 00:24:46.284
you wouldn't really understand.

00:24:47.931 --> 00:24:49.744
I understand you...

00:24:51.677 --> 00:24:53.870
more than anyone else.

00:24:56.885 --> 00:25:01.551
My husband was always busy and distant.

00:25:02.918 --> 00:25:05.655
Whenever he felt sorry,

00:25:05.655 --> 00:25:07.871
he made me a promise

00:25:07.871 --> 00:25:09.618
that when he retired,

00:25:09.618 --> 00:25:12.098
we'd walk the pilgrimage trail together.

00:25:13.387 --> 00:25:15.062
But he...

00:25:15.916 --> 00:25:18.576
he never got to keep that promise.

00:25:20.081 --> 00:25:22.181
I thought about it for a long time.

00:25:22.901 --> 00:25:25.708
'What would it even mean to go alone?'

00:25:27.875 --> 00:25:29.534
But in the end...

00:25:30.221 --> 00:25:32.747
I went by myself.

00:25:33.735 --> 00:25:35.441
Just like you.

00:25:52.117 --> 00:25:55.789
Do you know what I packed when I left?

00:26:00.395 --> 00:26:02.528
For the last day of the pilgrimage.

00:26:03.628 --> 00:26:05.535
For that day...

00:26:07.321 --> 00:26:10.574
I went from hospital to hospital,

00:26:12.041 --> 00:26:14.068
collecting sleeping pills.

00:26:37.848 --> 00:26:40.381
I poured all of them out,

00:26:41.901 --> 00:26:44.567
and lay still on the bed.

00:26:45.528 --> 00:26:47.301
And suddenly,

00:26:47.301 --> 00:26:49.868
I felt so sorry for myself.

00:27:13.486 --> 00:27:17.320
It wasn't that I wanted to live for my husband.

00:27:18.658 --> 00:27:20.731
I just felt so pitiful,

00:27:23.712 --> 00:27:26.145
and my life felt so unbearably sad.

00:27:28.448 --> 00:27:30.854
The life I still had left...

00:27:33.046 --> 00:27:35.180
it felt too precious to give up.

00:27:45.847 --> 00:27:48.114
Thank you.

00:27:48.114 --> 00:27:50.240
That must've been hard to talk about.

00:27:51.678 --> 00:27:53.291
I just wanted to say

00:27:54.058 --> 00:27:57.077
your life is not over yet.

00:27:59.991 --> 00:28:02.325
They say life is a festival.

00:28:12.141 --> 00:28:15.081
Our festival isn't over yet.

00:28:19.747 --> 00:28:21.654
Would you like to go outside?

00:29:01.875 --> 00:29:04.248
For our last song, we're taking requests.

00:29:04.248 --> 00:29:05.405
If you have one...

00:29:05.405 --> 00:29:09.185
How about a song your wife loves?

00:29:14.052 --> 00:29:15.735
No.

00:29:16.372 --> 00:29:18.938
Let's request a song you like, ma'am.

00:29:22.775 --> 00:29:24.503
My name is Ja Yeong.

00:29:25.195 --> 00:29:26.803
Jin Ja Yeong.

00:29:31.035 --> 00:29:32.971
Alright, Ja Yeong.

00:29:35.288 --> 00:29:37.987
Let's listen to a song you love together.

00:30:29.971 --> 00:30:31.984
Aren't we kind of overdoing it?

00:30:33.264 --> 00:30:34.701
I mean, coming all the way to pick him up?

00:30:34.701 --> 00:30:36.471
We're not usually this kind of family.

00:30:36.471 --> 00:30:40.417
Dad must've been so lonely traveling alone.

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:44.423
Yeah...

00:30:44.423 --> 00:30:46.690
He probably was.

00:30:49.038 --> 00:30:50.436
By the way...

00:30:50.436 --> 00:30:52.771
Since when do you say the right thing?

00:30:54.178 --> 00:30:55.638
Yeah, well.

00:30:55.638 --> 00:30:57.684
Guess your conscience is kicking in.

00:30:58.304 --> 00:31:00.811
You've been busy dating the guy next door, huh?

00:31:01.485 --> 00:31:04.118
How long has it been now?

00:31:08.235 --> 00:31:09.668
What...

00:31:09.668 --> 00:31:12.126
I was waiting for a comeback. Why so quiet?

00:31:12.126 --> 00:31:13.928
We really...

00:31:14.668 --> 00:31:17.895
aren't the good family to each other.

00:31:18.512 --> 00:31:20.375
Let's try.

00:31:20.375 --> 00:31:22.388
Quietly, so no one notices.

00:31:25.009 --> 00:31:27.221
Hey, Dad is here.

00:31:27.221 --> 00:31:29.259
Watch your faces. For Dad.

00:31:29.259 --> 00:31:31.079
Worry about yourself.

00:31:32.916 --> 00:31:36.389
Everyone in our group
had such strong personalities.

00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:37.889
Thanks to you,

00:31:37.889 --> 00:31:39.509
it was a great time.

00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:41.449
Me too.

00:31:41.449 --> 00:31:44.762
This trip will stay with me for a long time.

00:31:45.809 --> 00:31:47.895
- Dad!
- Over here!

00:31:49.949 --> 00:31:52.780
He looks okay, doesn't he?

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:56.313
He's probably holding it together.

00:31:57.407 --> 00:31:59.459
Wave nicely.

00:32:02.219 --> 00:32:04.527
Mr. Seo.

00:32:04.527 --> 00:32:07.333
It's time to wake up from forgetting.

00:32:16.745 --> 00:32:19.506
[Tree Burial Information Voucher]

00:32:19.506 --> 00:32:22.552
They say even the urn will
eventually decompose there.

00:32:23.397 --> 00:32:26.459
Everything turns back into soil.

00:32:26.459 --> 00:32:28.459
Isn't that a little off?

00:32:31.766 --> 00:32:34.072
What do you think, Dad?

00:32:46.963 --> 00:32:48.862
You guys haven't eaten yet, right?

00:33:08.618 --> 00:33:10.571
Is something wrong?

00:33:15.122 --> 00:33:16.755
No.

00:33:20.009 --> 00:33:22.488
I know this might sound weird, but...

00:33:24.422 --> 00:33:26.446
Mom passed away,

00:33:26.446 --> 00:33:28.846
and you're asking if something's wrong?

00:33:29.708 --> 00:33:31.635
Isn't that a little off?

00:33:47.313 --> 00:33:49.321
How about

00:33:49.321 --> 00:33:51.360
something spicy?

00:33:52.681 --> 00:33:54.754
Like what?

00:33:54.754 --> 00:33:56.994
Anything you're craving.

00:33:58.492 --> 00:34:00.534
Then...

00:34:00.534 --> 00:34:02.374
how about tteokbokki?

00:34:02.374 --> 00:34:04.427
Isn't that really spicy?

00:34:04.427 --> 00:34:06.260
You order it.

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:08.185
I don't have my phone now. Can you order?

00:34:08.185 --> 00:34:11.116
[Julia, Kim Mi Ran]

00:34:11.116 --> 00:34:13.069
Well done, Jun Kyung.

00:34:14.214 --> 00:34:15.735
Your mom...

00:34:15.735 --> 00:34:18.401
She was stuck at home all the time.

00:34:19.434 --> 00:34:23.020
This open place suits her better.

00:34:25.883 --> 00:34:27.593
My sister has a tree now.

00:34:27.593 --> 00:34:30.417
My dear... I may not come often, but...

00:34:30.417 --> 00:34:31.874
I'll visit whenever I can.

00:34:31.874 --> 00:34:33.847
Take care.

00:34:44.448 --> 00:34:47.084
- This is better.
- Yeah.

00:34:47.084 --> 00:34:49.137
- It's nice.
- It is.

00:34:51.044 --> 00:34:53.584
I feel so bad for your dad.

00:34:55.193 --> 00:34:58.946
He couldn't live without her.

00:34:58.946 --> 00:35:02.399
What if he does something reckless?

00:35:04.146 --> 00:35:07.046
It's not just the dead who deserve pity.

00:35:07.813 --> 00:35:10.039
The living do, too.

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:14.633
Take good care of your dad.

00:35:19.308 --> 00:35:20.541
You take care of yourself.

00:35:20.541 --> 00:35:22.709
And stop getting drunk for no reason.

00:35:22.709 --> 00:35:24.993
- Let's go.
- Have a drink with Jin Ho, too.

00:35:24.993 --> 00:35:26.479
I will.

00:35:29.373 --> 00:35:33.366
Don't forget about
the after-party at 6 tonight.

00:35:58.248 --> 00:36:00.008
Oh, hi.

00:36:00.008 --> 00:36:04.195
"Popularizing Korean folktales with AI?"

00:36:04.195 --> 00:36:06.068
Sounds boring.

00:36:10.493 --> 00:36:13.266
Do you want to hear something fun?

00:36:13.266 --> 00:36:14.689
You know Yuna, right?

00:36:14.689 --> 00:36:17.412
I'm doing the choreography for her new song.

00:36:18.182 --> 00:36:20.168
Oh, really?

00:36:20.168 --> 00:36:23.028
What if I get way too famous?

00:36:23.028 --> 00:36:24.555
Yeah.

00:36:29.602 --> 00:36:31.688
- You're annoying.
- What are you doing?

00:36:33.975 --> 00:36:35.179
Oh, right.

00:36:35.179 --> 00:36:36.918
Whose choreo did you say?

00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:42.716
That looks perfect on you.

00:36:44.568 --> 00:36:46.690
It does? On me?

00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:48.604
It's kind of flashy.

00:36:48.604 --> 00:36:51.603
You're my boyfriend. How would it not work?

00:36:57.976 --> 00:36:59.401
That's a lot of pressure.

00:36:59.401 --> 00:37:01.340
I'm about to get even more famous.

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:03.155
You'd better be ready for that.

00:37:03.155 --> 00:37:05.753
Aren't you sick of plaid shirts by now?

00:37:05.753 --> 00:37:07.547
Hey, isn't that Yoon Sol?

00:37:07.547 --> 00:37:09.219
I think it is.

00:37:09.219 --> 00:37:10.244
No way.

00:37:10.244 --> 00:37:12.293
It is me. Come here.

00:37:12.293 --> 00:37:14.023
I follow you on Instagram.

00:37:14.023 --> 00:37:16.297
You didn't follow me back, though...

00:37:16.297 --> 00:37:17.861
I will if you DM me.

00:37:17.861 --> 00:37:21.125
Could we get a photo with you?

00:37:21.125 --> 00:37:23.361
- Of course.
- Thank you.

00:37:23.361 --> 00:37:25.259
- This is so good.
- Delicious.

00:37:25.259 --> 00:37:26.922
It's tasty, right?

00:37:29.858 --> 00:37:31.162
Hey.

00:37:31.162 --> 00:37:32.863
Stop grilling and eat some.

00:37:32.863 --> 00:37:34.616
I am eating.

00:37:42.335 --> 00:37:46.163
You look better than a few days ago.

00:37:46.163 --> 00:37:48.361
Yeah, he must be eating well.

00:37:48.361 --> 00:37:49.732
Eating well?

00:37:49.732 --> 00:37:52.263
No, it's because
he doesn't have a nagging wife.

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:56.930
Oh, there you are.

00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:59.123
- Our guide is here.
- Hello.

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:01.439
Good to see you.

00:38:01.439 --> 00:38:03.740
You're pretty late, aren't you?

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:06.017
I come late on purpose when I'm off.

00:38:06.017 --> 00:38:09.389
I'm sick of showing up early
and taking care of everything.

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:12.837
Feels like it's been forever.

00:38:12.837 --> 00:38:15.342
So good to see everyone.

00:38:15.342 --> 00:38:16.779
Alright, eat up.

00:38:16.779 --> 00:38:18.768
- Let's toast.
- Sure.

00:38:20.078 --> 00:38:21.770
Cheers!

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:30.607
The losing married couple
will pay for the game. Okay?

00:38:30.607 --> 00:38:32.358
- Sounds good.
- Wait, hold on.

00:38:32.358 --> 00:38:34.169
They're not even a married couple.

00:38:34.169 --> 00:38:35.935
So what are they?

00:38:35.935 --> 00:38:38.522
- Losing team pays!
- Deal.

00:38:40.288 --> 00:38:42.686
I haven't played in like 20 years.

00:38:42.686 --> 00:38:46.573
Same. It's been over ten years for me.

00:38:46.573 --> 00:38:48.326
Uh-oh.

00:38:48.326 --> 00:38:50.693
Looks like we're paying for everything.

00:38:50.693 --> 00:38:52.386
Let's do our best.

00:39:24.243 --> 00:39:26.409
- Nothing went wrong, right?
- Yeah.

00:39:27.022 --> 00:39:28.289
Here she comes.

00:39:28.289 --> 00:39:29.618
Thank you, Doctor.

00:39:29.618 --> 00:39:31.270
Both the mother and the baby are healthy.

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:34.034
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

00:39:34.034 --> 00:39:36.440
- Thank you.
- We really appreciate it.

00:40:13.926 --> 00:40:15.957
Why did you do that?

00:40:15.957 --> 00:40:19.036
- You should've told her sooner.
- I was going to.

00:40:20.329 --> 00:40:22.135
But you know...

00:40:22.989 --> 00:40:24.476
I...

00:40:25.352 --> 00:40:26.945
And Jun Kyung...

00:40:28.972 --> 00:40:31.225
We only ran into each other a few times.

00:40:35.604 --> 00:40:37.377
At the convenience store...

00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:40.817
giving her a ride...

00:40:44.527 --> 00:40:46.747
If I'd said, "I have a kid."

00:40:49.636 --> 00:40:51.822
You know, I couldn't just do that.

00:40:56.625 --> 00:40:59.031
And then we started seeing each other...

00:41:03.171 --> 00:41:05.118
I didn't know...

00:41:06.644 --> 00:41:08.404
when to tell her the truth.

00:41:11.317 --> 00:41:13.398
I know it all sounds like excuses, but...

00:41:13.398 --> 00:41:15.870
Yeah. I get it.

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:19.131
When she said we should take it slow,

00:41:19.131 --> 00:41:20.768
I thought... okay.

00:41:20.768 --> 00:41:23.041
I'll wait for the right moment.

00:41:25.126 --> 00:41:27.112
That's what I kept telling myself.

00:41:48.113 --> 00:41:49.513
Hey.

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:51.979
You really liked her.

00:41:55.692 --> 00:41:56.716
Then,

00:41:56.716 --> 00:41:59.116
why don't you just reach out again?

00:42:00.971 --> 00:42:02.524
We're already over.

00:43:11.838 --> 00:43:13.578
Tell me.

00:43:14.905 --> 00:43:17.524
Let's hear your excuse.

00:43:41.334 --> 00:43:43.762
In this moment,

00:43:43.762 --> 00:43:45.568
I realized.

00:43:46.941 --> 00:43:51.367
I like him far more than I thought.

00:43:54.327 --> 00:43:57.221
Nothing's more certain than that.

00:43:59.479 --> 00:44:02.318
That's why I need to see him again.

00:44:32.324 --> 00:44:33.924
When I was 20,

00:44:34.713 --> 00:44:36.119
I was really...

00:44:37.499 --> 00:44:39.399
immature.

00:44:41.013 --> 00:44:42.425
Well...

00:44:44.119 --> 00:44:46.239
I still kind of am.

00:44:49.805 --> 00:44:51.931
My ex-girlfriend called me...

00:44:54.565 --> 00:44:56.965
two months after we broke up.

00:44:59.452 --> 00:45:02.805
She said she was pregnant.

00:45:06.801 --> 00:45:08.427
Suddenly,

00:45:12.854 --> 00:45:15.420
the idea of having a child...

00:45:17.546 --> 00:45:19.326
honestly...

00:45:22.866 --> 00:45:24.806
it scared me.

00:45:27.553 --> 00:45:29.620
The moment

00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:31.353
I saw his face...

00:45:35.275 --> 00:45:37.121
I felt overwhelmed,

00:45:39.388 --> 00:45:41.361
and touched,

00:45:42.995 --> 00:45:44.395
I was like...

00:45:46.035 --> 00:45:48.948
strangely moved.

00:45:49.734 --> 00:45:51.215
That's how I felt.

00:45:53.947 --> 00:45:55.907
But,

00:45:55.907 --> 00:45:57.973
we were already over,

00:45:58.614 --> 00:46:00.720
and trying to go back

00:46:02.455 --> 00:46:04.855
just out of responsibility...

00:46:07.334 --> 00:46:09.395
that wasn't possible.

00:46:11.729 --> 00:46:15.248
My ex took the baby
and went to Germany to study.

00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:18.760
We got back in touch

00:46:20.033 --> 00:46:21.913
last year.

00:46:25.621 --> 00:46:27.381
My son...

00:46:27.381 --> 00:46:29.481
he wanted to meet me.

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:33.986
He wanted to live in Korea.

00:46:37.159 --> 00:46:38.679
So,

00:46:39.939 --> 00:46:42.745
after 14 years,

00:46:42.745 --> 00:46:44.445
I met him.

00:46:56.090 --> 00:46:57.923
What is his name?

00:47:06.472 --> 00:47:08.252
Daniel.

00:47:11.577 --> 00:47:13.204
Im Daniel.

00:47:14.331 --> 00:47:15.855
He's 15.

00:47:16.462 --> 00:47:18.241
And really tall.

00:47:21.216 --> 00:47:23.556
He's at that cynical teenage phase, huh?

00:47:26.345 --> 00:47:28.292
Yeah.

00:47:28.292 --> 00:47:29.851
It really is.

00:47:30.957 --> 00:47:33.610
That tiny little kid...

00:47:36.225 --> 00:47:38.225
while he was growing up...

00:47:43.005 --> 00:47:45.364
I couldn't do anything for him.

00:47:50.118 --> 00:47:51.883
That's it.

00:47:53.217 --> 00:47:55.010
That's my excuse.

00:47:56.337 --> 00:47:58.983
What I really wanted to say to you...

00:48:02.871 --> 00:48:04.750
with no excuses...

00:48:07.667 --> 00:48:09.540
is that...

00:48:13.062 --> 00:48:16.075
I'm truly sorry.

00:48:17.195 --> 00:48:19.228
I already forgave you.

00:48:22.928 --> 00:48:25.668
From the moment I saw your face earlier.

00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:44.046
Oh, there's something I want to give you.

00:48:50.016 --> 00:48:52.116
Wait, did you have this?

00:48:58.198 --> 00:49:00.250
If we hadn't broken up,

00:49:01.144 --> 00:49:04.150
you'd still be listening to music
from just one side, forever.

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:15.501
Thanks to you,
we didn't have to pay for the game.

00:49:15.501 --> 00:49:17.508
I feel bad for everyone else, though.

00:49:17.508 --> 00:49:21.101
You don't look that sorry.
You were trying pretty hard.

00:49:21.101 --> 00:49:23.599
I'm not usually competitive,

00:49:23.599 --> 00:49:25.942
but tonight, I really didn't want to lose.

00:49:25.942 --> 00:49:27.399
Really? Why?

00:49:27.399 --> 00:49:30.511
I don't mind losing on my own,
but you would've lost too.

00:49:31.726 --> 00:49:34.471
- You are so nice.
- Oh, come on.

00:49:34.471 --> 00:49:36.519
I'm serious.

00:49:36.519 --> 00:49:39.092
You're tall for your age,

00:49:39.092 --> 00:49:41.427
no belly or anything.

00:49:41.427 --> 00:49:43.234
I'm sucking it in right now.

00:49:43.921 --> 00:49:46.367
If you just dyed the gray a bit...

00:49:48.447 --> 00:49:50.867
you'd probably look younger than me.

00:49:52.869 --> 00:49:54.738
You said it'd been ten years since you bowled.

00:49:54.738 --> 00:49:56.334
How were you that good?

00:49:56.334 --> 00:49:59.247
I try hard not to forget, that's all.

00:50:00.127 --> 00:50:04.161
When things are tough, I try to forget,

00:50:04.161 --> 00:50:06.641
and when things are good,

00:50:06.641 --> 00:50:08.452
I try not to.

00:50:08.452 --> 00:50:10.785
Does that really work whenever you want it to?

00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:15.503
Are you curious?

00:50:15.503 --> 00:50:17.528
Is this really okay?

00:50:17.528 --> 00:50:18.874
What is?

00:50:18.874 --> 00:50:22.960
Me coming over like this,
to a woman living alone.

00:50:24.886 --> 00:50:26.780
You're not...

00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:29.546
getting any weird ideas, are you?

00:50:29.546 --> 00:50:31.246
What?

00:50:31.246 --> 00:50:33.673
No, don't misunderstand.

00:50:57.236 --> 00:50:59.603
Oh! You scared me.

00:50:59.603 --> 00:51:01.944
This is Bom.

00:51:01.944 --> 00:51:03.378
Hello?

00:51:03.378 --> 00:51:05.821
- I didn't scare her, did I?
- Not at all.

00:51:05.821 --> 00:51:09.434
Did you have fun today? Say hello to him.

00:51:09.434 --> 00:51:12.314
This place used to be a pool hall.

00:51:12.314 --> 00:51:15.159
With my work and my personality,
I move around a lot.

00:51:15.159 --> 00:51:18.174
I never needed a place that felt like home.

00:51:18.174 --> 00:51:21.194
Kind of unusual, right?

00:51:22.258 --> 00:51:23.601
No.

00:51:23.601 --> 00:51:25.624
I think it's really wonderful.

00:51:25.624 --> 00:51:27.431
It kind of feels like...

00:51:27.431 --> 00:51:29.584
a hideout.

00:51:52.732 --> 00:51:54.558
You really are

00:51:56.845 --> 00:51:59.011
an incredible person.

00:52:02.094 --> 00:52:04.698
Some people buy souvenirs,

00:52:04.698 --> 00:52:06.582
take pictures,

00:52:06.582 --> 00:52:09.164
and post them on social media.

00:52:09.164 --> 00:52:11.164
But I just...

00:52:11.164 --> 00:52:12.977
draw.

00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:15.935
The things I want to remember,

00:52:15.935 --> 00:52:17.539
the way they felt,

00:52:17.539 --> 00:52:20.510
the people I met
and the conversations we shared.

00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:22.436
So I don't forget them.

00:52:23.872 --> 00:52:26.338
That's how I remember things.

00:52:29.618 --> 00:52:32.051
What do you want to remember right now?

00:52:36.624 --> 00:52:38.444
May I see it?

00:52:40.584 --> 00:52:42.757
- Yes.
- Thank you.

00:52:50.215 --> 00:52:51.615
Oh.

00:52:54.595 --> 00:52:57.401
It still has a long way to go.

00:53:24.474 --> 00:53:26.520
Are you really Seo Jun Seo?

00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:29.520
- What?
- What is that?

00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:31.687
Are you being punished or something?

00:53:31.687 --> 00:53:33.894
- Doesn't suit me, right?
- Yeah. Not at all.

00:53:34.847 --> 00:53:36.634
Sol bought it for me.

00:53:37.266 --> 00:53:39.058
It really doesn't suit you.

00:53:39.058 --> 00:53:40.984
I thought so too.

00:53:48.479 --> 00:53:51.446
Why are you two dating if you don't even match?

00:53:53.173 --> 00:53:55.146
Because I like her.

00:53:55.146 --> 00:53:56.986
Because she's pretty, right?

00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:59.680
Well...

00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:01.057
She is cool.

00:54:01.057 --> 00:54:03.707
She knows what she wants.

00:54:03.707 --> 00:54:05.960
She does everything well.

00:54:07.027 --> 00:54:10.414
So why would she like me?

00:54:10.414 --> 00:54:12.480
A loser like me.

00:54:13.594 --> 00:54:15.573
How are you a loser?

00:54:17.671 --> 00:54:19.551
You're cool too.

00:54:20.491 --> 00:54:22.111
Seriously?

00:54:22.751 --> 00:54:24.557
In what way?

00:54:30.237 --> 00:54:32.180
She is always busy,

00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:34.763
always making you anxious.

00:54:34.763 --> 00:54:38.404
That skinny girl.
I don't even think she's that pretty.

00:54:38.404 --> 00:54:40.664
But you're always on her side.

00:54:41.917 --> 00:54:44.823
Yeah, that's what makes you a cool guy.

00:54:50.929 --> 00:54:52.482
What are you doing?

00:54:52.482 --> 00:54:55.785
What does it matter if you think I'm cool?

00:54:55.785 --> 00:54:57.559
Sol is the one who needs to think so.

00:54:57.559 --> 00:54:59.665
Why can't it be me?

00:55:01.432 --> 00:55:03.372
Let's stop.

00:55:03.372 --> 00:55:05.119
See you later.

00:55:21.561 --> 00:55:23.214
Dad?

00:55:30.362 --> 00:55:34.529
A grandma in my sister's village raised Bom.

00:55:35.494 --> 00:55:38.460
She passed away, and Bom was left alone.

00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:39.974
That's awful.

00:55:39.974 --> 00:55:43.380
I was lonely, so I took her in.

00:55:44.074 --> 00:55:48.267
But she spends more time
at doggy daycare than with me.

00:55:48.267 --> 00:55:50.454
I keep telling myself I'm busy,

00:55:50.454 --> 00:55:52.894
and I think it's making her feel lonely.

00:55:56.989 --> 00:56:00.535
Is the man in that drawing your husband?

00:56:01.422 --> 00:56:03.079
Never.

00:56:03.079 --> 00:56:05.765
Yeah? That's a relief.

00:56:06.949 --> 00:56:09.972
He was a guest on a couples tour,

00:56:09.972 --> 00:56:11.863
and he kept hitting on me.

00:56:11.863 --> 00:56:16.535
I mean, his wife was right there.
What was he even thinking?

00:56:16.535 --> 00:56:19.225
It was a cruise,
so there was nowhere to escape.

00:56:19.225 --> 00:56:23.202
It was really uncomfortable and upsetting.

00:56:23.202 --> 00:56:26.422
I drew him so I could curse him for life.

00:56:26.422 --> 00:56:27.672
What the...

00:56:27.672 --> 00:56:29.777
That guy is a total jerk.

00:56:29.777 --> 00:56:33.162
A married creep, seriously.

00:56:34.162 --> 00:56:35.646
Oh, you swear too?

00:56:35.646 --> 00:56:37.917
Anyone with common sense would.

00:56:37.917 --> 00:56:39.728
He is a bastard.

00:56:49.229 --> 00:56:50.860
- You can take the call.
- Okay.

00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:53.573
[My Son]

00:56:55.353 --> 00:56:57.207
Hey, Jun Seo.

00:56:57.207 --> 00:56:58.232
What?

00:56:58.232 --> 00:57:00.461
Oh, is it that late already?

00:57:00.461 --> 00:57:01.551
Yeah.

00:57:01.551 --> 00:57:04.312
I'm just hanging out with friends.

00:57:04.312 --> 00:57:07.961
Okay. I'll head home soon, don't worry.

00:57:07.961 --> 00:57:09.947
I'm coming now.

00:57:09.947 --> 00:57:11.794
I said I'm on my way.

00:57:11.794 --> 00:57:13.360
Bye.

00:57:17.872 --> 00:57:19.972
You should probably go home.

00:57:23.772 --> 00:57:25.172
Yeah.

00:57:27.118 --> 00:57:29.657
We're out of drinks anyway,

00:57:29.657 --> 00:57:31.898
and it's pretty late.

00:57:49.775 --> 00:57:51.175
Hey, Bom.

00:57:53.663 --> 00:57:55.363
I'm heading out now.

00:57:55.363 --> 00:57:58.542
Hope we can see each other again.

00:57:58.542 --> 00:58:00.156
Take care.

00:58:02.310 --> 00:58:04.249
I'll get going.

00:58:05.099 --> 00:58:07.012
Do you want to stay the night?

00:58:39.804 --> 00:58:41.944
Weren't you heading home?

00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:45.297
I felt like I needed another drink,

00:58:46.424 --> 00:58:48.910
so I stopped by the convenience store.

00:58:51.307 --> 00:58:52.746
Is it really...

00:58:55.159 --> 00:58:56.982
Is it okay if I stay over?

00:59:38.146 --> 00:59:41.549
- Doesn't she have a lover?
- Yeah, but he is not a good boy for Sol.

00:59:41.549 --> 00:59:44.030
He's some grad school loser.

00:59:44.030 --> 00:59:46.270
So I'd shoot my shot.

00:59:46.270 --> 00:59:48.969
- I want to say it's true love, but...
- Call the cops!

00:59:48.969 --> 00:59:51.636
Do you think I'll be in Sol's future?

00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:55.431
I was scared that people might notice

00:59:55.431 --> 00:59:57.038
how much I like you.

00:59:57.038 --> 00:59:59.021
Do you really think Julia would want to see

00:59:59.021 --> 01:00:00.884
you beating yourself up like this?

01:00:00.884 --> 01:00:02.715
You don't need to blame yourself.

01:00:02.715 --> 01:00:05.980
I'm done worrying about
what other people think.

01:00:06.827 --> 01:00:08.484
Dad?

01:00:08.484 --> 01:00:10.417
What was that?

01:00:10.417 --> 01:00:11.801
Hello.

01:00:11.801 --> 01:00:15.291
Daniel, I want you
to get to know my girlfriend.

01:00:15.291 --> 01:00:16.889
You're cooking? That's new.

01:00:16.889 --> 01:00:19.649
Why are you being so nice to him?

01:00:20.461 --> 01:00:22.208
She is insane.

01:00:23.015 --> 01:00:25.171
Sorry, Jun Kyung.

01:00:25.171 --> 01:00:27.781
What? Did you already get dumped?
