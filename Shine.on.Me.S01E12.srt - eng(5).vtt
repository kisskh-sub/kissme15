00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:17.580
to me yesterday.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.300
I thought she'd spend her whole life

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.820
pretending

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.140
nothing ever happened,

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.300
and never owning up to it.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.800
But since she did apologize,

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:27.340
it reminded me

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:29.920
I still owe her an answer.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.440
She asked me back then

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.620
if I still had feelings for you.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.460
I think I can finally answer her now.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.020
No, I really don't.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.620

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:52.520
to relax.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.600

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:02.680
No need to fill Ye Rong in.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:06.460
But it's a weight

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.120
off my shoulders.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:17.560
It's actually pathetic.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.680

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:22.740
a promise

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.100
had such a short shelf life.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:30.860

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.260

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:26.620
Did you really change

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:27.580
into another outfit?

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.080
This looks gorgeous on you too.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.080
You're totally outshining

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:31.620
my bridal wardrobe

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:32.480
with all these changes.

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:33.620
That's just because

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:34.800
she accidentally got her dress stained.

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:36.480
The snow is going
to get a lot worse later.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:37.780
Traffic will be a nightmare,

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.380
so we've decided to head out now.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:41.720
But how are you guys getting back?

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:43.340
Xiguang,

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:44.840
he was drinking.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.600
No way he's driving, right?

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.180
We'll grab a cab.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.820
I'll have someone pick up the car later.

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:51.040
Okay. Safety first.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:52.380
Thanks for coming,

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.480
you guys.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.680
I'll let you get going.

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:56.880
Go, do your thing.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:57.960
Let's catch up soon.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:15:59.680
See you.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:00.400
Take good care of her, okay?

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:48.280
Apparently, my confession

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:50.200
just knocks people speechless.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.060
Sorry.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.040
Nie Xiguang,

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.060
it shouldn't be like this

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:21.400
if you're turning me down.

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:24.460
You should be holding your head high
and saying,

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:25.800
"Lin Yusen,

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:27.599
I'm not exactly falling for you.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.640
You haven't made the cut."

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.400
Instead of acting like this,

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:33.540
as if you owe me

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:34.700
something.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.520
That's not it.

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:37.040
It's not that you didn't make the cut.

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:41.200
It's just...

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:45.800
I haven't

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:48.280
quite moved on

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.480
from someone I used to care for.

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:52.300
You saw it

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:54.060
back there.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.760
If you're going to be with someone,

00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.300
you need to be all in.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:01.740
And right now,

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:05.800
I'm just not there.

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:12.040
Actually,

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:14.660
back at the hotel,

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:16.720
I lied.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:18.540
I said

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:20.760
I'd be an idiot

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:21.940
not to seize the moment.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.340
But in fact,

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.340
confessing to you then

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:29.260
is where the real stupidity
would have been.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:31.880
It would've made a mockery

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:33.920
of the whole "annual plan"
I stayed up all night

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:34.720
mapping out.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:38.300
But

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.720
it turns out

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:42.860
these things

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:46.640
don't follow a script.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.400
It's a first for me.

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:57.200
Quite the experience, actually.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.420
I knew you'd turn me down,

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:03.160
but

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:04.780
so soon?

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:06.840
Now what?

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.000
My pride

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.880
is taking a bit of a hit.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.260
Anyway, it was expected.

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:19.600
It's like being handed

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:21.400
a death sentence with a tumor,

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:22.820
only to be told

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.680
it's benign.

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:27.220
Alright.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.440
I guess we'll just have to
play the long game.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.260
Let's leave it at that for now.

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:34.240
We'll pick this up back in Suzhou.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.180
A

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.120
tumor?

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.180
That was

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.020
a clumsy metaphor.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.660
I'm not going back to Suzhou.

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:58.560
I'm

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.620
heading to Wuxi.

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:01.880
I still have

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:02.880
a day and a half of leave, anyway.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.340
And I haven't seen

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:05.420
my mom in ages.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:06.940
Besides, I've been really craving her...

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:08.140
You don't need a reason to go home.

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:14.280
Alright then.

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:16.200
Let me at least drop you

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:17.940
at the station.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:21.620
No, it's fine.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:23.240
I'll just

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.640
grab a cab.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.140
Nie Xiguang,

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:31.600
are you going

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.040
to avoid me forever now?

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:38.780
No.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.040
It feels wrong

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:49.300
to let you help me,

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.680
knowing I can't give you what you want.

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:53.320
Well,

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.420
I'm not exactly an expert at this.

00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:58.460
But isn't this just

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.140
how

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:01.180
the whole "pursuit" thing works?

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:03.780
So,

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.140
not only are you turning me down,

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:08.480
you're telling me
I'm not even allowed to try?

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:14.320
What if I'm never going

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.020
to...?

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:20.180
I don't want

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:21.420
to string you along like that.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:23.660
Nie Xiguang.

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:26.920
It's one thing to have
no confidence in yourself,

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.660
but why do you have
so little faith in me?

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:31.460
Didn't you say

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.240
I was great at everything I do?

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:38.600
You're the kind of girl

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:39.980
who can't even

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.100
bring herself to say

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:43.900
a flat-out "Never to accept me".

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:45.920
With a heart as soft as yours,

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:47.520
how much of a failure would I be

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:48.800
if I couldn't win you over?

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.240
Too scared to let me give you a ride?

00:21:58.640 --> 00:21:59.680
I'm just courting you.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.380
This isn't some business deal.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:05.320
I'm not looking for an ROI.

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:08.200
Why do you feel like

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:09.820
you owe me

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:11.420
just for saying no?

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:14.800
I want this

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:16.500
to be something good for you,

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:18.160
not a weight on your shoulders.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:19.960
You say...

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.040
you still have feelings for him.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:24.420
That's fine.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.100
Take your pick.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:31.260
♪Will we ever be close, you and me?♪

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:36.280
♪Oh, wherever you are,
whatever you want♪

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:39.740
♪Don't hesitate to call me,
just let me know♪

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:43.940
♪I hope you'll never forget♪

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.980
♪My heart has only you♪

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:50.380
♪Every moment of every day♪

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:54.020
♪Our love's gonna find a way♪

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:00.680
I'm completely worn out today.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:02.660
Let's just grab a cab.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:04.740
I'll give you a lift.

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:06.180
I'm heading that way anyway.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:08.680
No, it's okay.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.140
I've still got some work to finish up.

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:16.180
And the subway is a straight shot.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:19.860
See you around.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:24.620
Zhuang Xu, stop right there.

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:36.100
There's something

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:38.320
I've been wanting to say
since yesterday.

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:39.480
I thought

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.860
maybe it's all in the past

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:42.200
and it didn't really

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.160
matter anymore.

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:45.700
But now I just can't

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:46.680
keep it in anymore.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:49.840
Why didn't you tell me you moved

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.380
to Investment Banking at Huaya?

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:53.620
It was just a standard transfer.

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:55.640
Nothing special.

00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:58.860
Then why were you so quick

00:23:59.220 --> 00:23:59.640
to bring it up

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.880
the moment you saw her today?

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.180
You can say
it was Zhuo Hui who brought it up.

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.000
But you'd rather tell Zhuo Hui than me?

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:13.840
And another thing,

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:15.660
where did you go

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.500
when you walked out suddenly?

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.020
You just bolted out of here to find her.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:21.260
Don't you feel...

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:25.840
humiliated?

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:33.880
It has nothing

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:37.080
to do with you.

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:43.680
Nothing to do with me?

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:46.460
Why?

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:48.960
Didn't we grow up together?

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.200
Aren't we childhood sweethearts?

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:51.180
Did you never once

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:54.660
have feelings for me?

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.240
I didn't know

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.100
that I had to be held accountable
for feelings

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:08.880
that were never even confirmed.

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.440
Are you blaming me?

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:15.320
Yes.

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:17.420
I was cautious, I know.

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:17.820
But

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.240
is that so wrong?

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:21.480
If I were still the same person

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:22.780
I used to be,

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:24.760
I could afford to be reckless

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:25.980
and risk everything,

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:26.800
because I could actually

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.540
back us up.

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:30.200
But

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:32.940
am I that person anymore?

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.340
No, I'm not.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.340
I learned the hard way

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.380
how cruel the world can be,

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:46.920
and how quickly people change.

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:49.760
Is it really a crime

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.920
that I didn't want to rush into this?

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.380
I just value

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:56.760
our bond too much.

00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.200
What if we got together

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:00.140
only to realize

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:01.000
it wasn't working?

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:03.720
Would reality tear us apart so badly

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:04.960
that we couldn't even stay friends?

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.440
How thoughtful of you.

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.140
You're so much more mature than I am.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:21.740
Are you mocking me?

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:25.040
Are you taking out

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:25.980
all the frustration you felt

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.300
with Nie Xiguang

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:28.580
on me?

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:29.760
Why do you keep bringing her into this?

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.500
What's between us

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:38.660
has never had anything to do with her.

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.200
Am I the one bringing her into this?

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:43.080
If she hadn't met you

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:43.720
and started pursuing you,

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:45.720
things wouldn't be so messy between us.

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:46.820
What exactly

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:49.260
did you tell her about us

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:50.320
back in college?

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.020
Is it about Zhuang Xu?

00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:56.560
Yes.

00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:58.440
Him?

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.280
Even though

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:01.380
we've been neighbors since childhood,

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:02.840
I don't really know him that well.

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:04.240
You're asking the wrong person.

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:06.920
Xiguang is going all out

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:09.020
to win over Zhuang Xu.

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.260
How can you be so unfazed?

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:13.620
Aren't you worried

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:15.440
she'll actually steal him away?

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.220
Don't you think

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:21.900
she's the perfect touchstone?

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.080
She's from a wealthy family,

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:25.160
and she's got the looks.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:26.580
If Zhuang Xu

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:28.140
can turn down this golden opportunity,

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.040
I might actually believe

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:31.860
he'll never have a change of heart.

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:34.320
Still...

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.360
you seem so sure of yourself.

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:40.560
You've got Zhuang Xu
wrapped around your finger, right?

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.740
What did she tell you?

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:49.080
You believe her over me?

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.520
Always that same line.

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:57.280
Sometimes I think

00:27:58.580 --> 00:27:59.960
maybe whatever's between you and her

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:03.420
was never about me at all.

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:10.040
You're just

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:10.780
using me

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:14.000
to one-up her.

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:16.520
She's your imaginary enemy...

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.440
but it was never about me.

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:24.540
What are you talking about?

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:25.800
Ye Rong,

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:28.460
do we really have to

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:29.480
spell it out?

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:33.680
Forget it.

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:37.560
It doesn't matter anymore.

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:42.380
Life finally

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:43.740
beat some sense into me.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:47.240
It's best

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:51.120
if we just move on.

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:56.200
Move on?

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:01.020
So that's how it is.

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:04.620
Makes sense.

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:06.740
Your female colleagues
in Investment Banking

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:08.840
might come
from an even more powerful family

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:09.920
than Nie Xiguang.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:11.500
However,

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.320
you don't have to
be so full of yourself

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:16.940
or insult me like this.

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:21.540
Did you really think

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.280
I wouldn't have

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.360
better options than you

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.140
in a city like Shanghai?

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:35.620
Good to know.

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:00.540
I used to

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:04.580
always take your word for it.

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:07.800
Thanks, Senior.

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:13.940
Nie Xiguang.

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:19.840
It was her.

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:22.400
The senior made it very clear:

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:24.360
the interview calls went out

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:25.820
first thing Monday afternoon.

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:27.240
I was on that list.

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:29.640
But that afternoon,

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:30.960
Nie Xiguang
was the only one in the dorm.

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:32.960
She took the call,

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:33.840
but she never told me.

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:36.100
There must be a mix‑up.

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:37.660
I don't think
she'd do something like that.

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:39.280
Why wouldn't she?

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:43.000
The facts are right in front of you.

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.180
Tell me, Zhuang Xu.

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:45.020
Why wouldn't she?

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.240
Are you saying she didn't have a motive?

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.400
Why do you trust her so much?

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:52.240
Maybe the person making the calls

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:54.140
just missed your name.

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:56.780
Zhuang Xu.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:00.820
You've changed.

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:03.580
You weren't always like this.

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:05.320
I really thought
you were the only constant in my life.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:07.740
Let me tell you something:

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:09.740
that is exactly who Nie Xiguang is.

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:11.840
She's arrogant and self-centered.

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:13.280
She just has to
have whatever she wants,

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:14.320
and couldn't care less

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:15.220
about others' feelings.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:16.740
But I didn't think

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:17.940
she'd go this far.

00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:19.580
If you don't believe me,

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.520
go ask your senior.

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:23.360
There's always a record

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.640
of those calls, isn't there?

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:27.260
If they never made the call,

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:31.000
I'll apologize for my suspicions.

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.420
But if they did,

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:35.760
you have to stand by me.

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.760
I'm going to confront her
in front of everyone.

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:43.160
Xu,

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:45.760
is Jiang Rui's cousin

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:46.800
into you?

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:53.640
Who told you that?

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:56.520
Rong told me.

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.000
She wasn't bad-mouthing her.

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:00.780
She just seemed a bit upset.

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:02.460
Jiang Rui's cousin

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:03.660
seems pretty overbearing.

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.380
Knowing full well about you and Rong,

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.060
she still bragged in the dorm

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.120
about how she's going to win you over.

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:15.540
I see.

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:19.660
Xu,

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:21.260
do you like her?

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:24.840
I don't think what she's doing

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.100
is right.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.620
Focus on your studies.

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:31.980
This is none of your business.

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:37.900
Just a few more lessons for Jiang Rui.

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.000
After that, I'm done.

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:41.360
Xu.

[Inpatient]

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:43.660
How about

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:45.140
we borrow from Aunt

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.000
to settle with Jiang Rui's cousin?

about Jiang Rui's cousin
lending you money.

but

00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:58.760
she's been saying in the dorm

that she helped you,

00:35:58.580 --> 00:35:59.640
Isn't it about time?

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.440
Come on, give me a guy's take,

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.420
and help me break it down.

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:04.060
If I confess now,

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.340
do you think I've got a good shot?

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.260
You should've gone for it ages ago.

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:08.600
Why bother earning brownie points?

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:09.900
You don't need them.

00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:12.320
Never mind.

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:15.000
Actually, it's still a bit too soon
for that.

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:17.600
Let me give it some thought

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:19.160
and come up with the perfect plan.

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:20.340
What plan?

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.380
I pulled an all-nighter to finish one.

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:23.740
Care for a look?

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:46.140
That color

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.720
looks great on you.

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:48.220
Right?

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:51.820
Ms. Zhou.

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:54.960
It's been ages since I last saw you.

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:56.840
Look at you, all grown up

00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:58.040
and more stunning than ever.

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.140
Why do you still have such dark circles

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.360
when you slept in so late?

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:04.580
I didn't sleep well.

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:07.120
There's soy milk,

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:07.980
youtiao, and pancakes in the kitchen.

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:10.060
Just ask Ms. Yan
to warm them up for you.

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:11.540
Once you're done, come have a chat

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:12.000
with Ms. Zhou.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:12.380
Okay.

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:14.580
Eat over here.

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:15.140
Okay.

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:21.600
Xiguang,

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:22.740
I heard

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:24.280
you're working in Suzhou?

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:27.860
She applied all by herself.

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:29.820
Turns out the place

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:30.640
is actually a Yuancheng investment.

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:31.740
Small world, right?

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:32.720
So,

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:34.560
I figured I'd let her
learn the ropes there.

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:36.300
It's nice and all,

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:37.860
but if she's not working in Wuxi,

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.420
dating becomes such a hassle.

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:40.800
You don't want her ending up

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:42.360
with some guy from Suzhou.

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:43.380
That's a bit of a stretch.

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:46.720
She's still young.

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:47.320
Honestly,

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:49.280
I haven't even given it a thought.

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:51.480
Has no one come to you
wanting to set her up?

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:53.260
Oh, there are plenty,

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:54.880
but the matches didn't seem right,

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:55.720
so I turned them all down.

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:00.440
Xiguang.

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:02.520
You can date,

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:04.420
but you need

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:05.380
to take your time.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.860
You should date for at least two years

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:08.980
to see his true character, okay?

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:10.140
Ideally,

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:11.920
it should be someone local.

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:13.920
Suzhou is just way too far.

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:14.380
Exactly.

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:15.760
Just listen to your mother.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:17.280
Remember Ms. Sun's daughter?

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.420
She married someone from Zhejiang.

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:19.080
And now?

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:20.080
They only get to see each other

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:21.140
once every month or two.

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:23.720
I got it.

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:26.060
Look at her, she's blushing.

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:28.120
She's got her head buried in her bowl.

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:29.220
Oh, by the way,

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:30.780
your uncle mentioned

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:31.780
that for Chinese New Year,

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:34.140
our family should go on a trip abroad.

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:35.540
Would you like to go?

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:37.320
Where to?

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:39.200
He suggested Switzerland.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:40.960
We'd rent a chalet

00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:41.600
and go skiing.

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:42.740
I'm still on the fence, though,

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:44.840
as you've always been afraid of flying.

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:47.180
I'm fine.

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:49.140
If you want to go, Mom, we'll go.

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:50.900
But if it's for skiing,

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:52.440
why do we have to go abroad?

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.400
We can do that here,

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:55.640
like Xinjiang or Changbai Mountain.

00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:57.260
Why fly so far?

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:58.560
I only have a few days off anyway.

00:38:59.020 --> 00:38:59.760
True.

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:02.300
Flying abroad

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:03.560
takes over twenty hours.

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:05.060
I've never been

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:05.980
to Changbai Mountain.

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:07.160
It might be worth a visit.

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:09.440
I'll talk to your aunt.

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:11.680
After you finish breakfast,

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.680
go visit your grandparents.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:14.640
You might not

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:15.900
have much time to spend with them

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:16.800
during Chinese New Year.

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:17.800
Okay.

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:24.480
After lunch

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:25.240
at your grandparents',

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:26.260
be back early.

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:28.360
You've still got that trip to Suzhou.

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:29.100
Got it.

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:30.820
Should I pack
some Jingqiao sesame cakes for you?

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:32.600
If you're the one craving them,
just buy some.

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:33.720
Don't use me as an excuse.

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:35.600
I'll get going.

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:36.640
Bye, Ms. Zhou.

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:37.940
Drive safe.

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.080
Take it easy, okay?

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:39.660
Got it.

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:46.080
Since when did Xiguang start driving?

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:48.620
I made her get her license
right after the gaokao.

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:51.800
So you're still in touch

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:52.760
with your former in-laws?

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:55.220
I don't go there myself.

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:56.460
But Xiguang does.

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:57.740
Those are two separate matters.

00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:00.340
Her grandparents are really kind.

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:01.980
Back when I first got married,

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.800
Nie Chengyuan and I were busy
running the business,

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:05.940
and my parents weren't in good health.

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:08.020
So Xiguang was basically raised by them.

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:09.180
They've built a real bond.

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:10.540
And now,

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.280
with my parents gone,

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:13.940
I can't let Xiguang

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:15.420
lose that bond

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:16.120
with them either.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.860
- Grandma!
- Sweetheart!

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:38.580
Welcome back!

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:39.980
[Grandma of Xiguang]
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.620
I needed to prep the meal.

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:43.760
I called

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.160
Grandpa earlier.

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:46.360
He said you were home.

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:47.660
That old man

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:48.880
hasn't told me a thing.

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:49.820
He isn't even back yet.

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:52.000
He must've forgotten.

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:53.580
Are you going to the fields?

00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:54.460
I'll join you.

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.200
Okay, let's go.

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:57.060
I've

00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:58.340
opened up a new spot

00:40:58.420 --> 00:40:59.700
for broccoli.

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:01.120
Don't you city folks love that stuff?

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:03.160
I'll save the best ones for you
when they're ready.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.100
- Okay?
- Alright.

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:05.320
Park the car inside.

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:06.160
Okay.

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:17.320
Guang.

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:18.220
Here.

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:19.760
Let's go.

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:20.280
Come on.

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:35.520
Grandma, who's that guy?

00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:37.140
That's Qian Fangping's father.

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:40.080
Homewreckers will get
what's coming to them.

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:43.080
That old scumbag

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:44.740
has been trouble since he was young,

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:45.860
always a total sleazebag.

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:47.560
Never did a day's work in the fields.

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:50.040
These days
he's just some wannabe fortune-teller,

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:51.840
still messing around
pretending to be all mystical.

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:54.640
He's absolute trash,
through and through,

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:56.320
always out there swindling people.

00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:58.060
Your father is such a good-for-nothing.

00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.040
That home-wrecker Qian

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:00.520
literally

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.820
tore our family apart.

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:04.280
I swear, your dad must be cursed
to have met her.

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:07.300
Guang, don't worry.

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:09.080
If she ever tries to marry your dad,

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.260
I will

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:12.180
lie down right at your dad's office door

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:12.940
and not let him leave.

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:13.920
Grandma,

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:15.700
when my parents were getting a divorce,

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:16.780
you tried that too.

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:18.480
I was just about to lie down,

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:19.700
and you pulled me back up.

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:22.540
Alright.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:23.480
Let's go.

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.920
I'm not afraid of him anyway.

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:47.290

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:50.420
