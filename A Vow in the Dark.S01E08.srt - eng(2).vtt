00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:49.670
Jie Chuan.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.920
Great Demon,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.320
I am Ji Li.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.870
Come here.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.320
Have you forgotten
I am a goldfish?

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.310
Move forward,

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.040
and I swim down.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.230
It's truly sinking to the bottom.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.000
Congratulations, sir.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.560
You've become Chief of Ji Ling.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.760
Please, this way, sir.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.430
Rest assured.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.350
In fifteen minutes, I will recover.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.950
I'll come find you then.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.190
Lady Official.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.800
This fish is especially plump today.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.120
Don't ruin it when you cook it.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.840
Lady Official, leave it to me.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.590
You'll be satisfied.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.000
Your Grace, Jie Chuan.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.080
Come back! Help me!

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.120
Master, save me!

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.520
See? It's full of strength.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.560
This fish is meant for Lady Serpent.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.840
Go on, tell me.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.150
How will you prepare it?

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.590
The fish must be drenched with hot oil.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.030
That way the scales
turn wonderfully crispy.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.840
This is the first dish.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.270
My knife work is skillful.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.800
With one clean cut,

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.400
the fish head is severed.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.360
The tail still twitches with life.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.960
Steamed is the most delicious.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.750
There's also a method
from the Western Regions.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.910
Slice a live fish into 108 cuts.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.150
The flesh turns crystal clear.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.430
When it's brought to the table,

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.630
the fish is still breathing
for freshness.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.560
This is called a fish for three dishes.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.430
Well, this is great.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:15.710
This fish…

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.280
Ruthless cook,

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.030
I'll deal with you myself.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.280
Stop arguing.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.240
Master.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.650
Hurry, we must leave.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.600
Soon someone will come.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.480
Alright.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.180
(Cave, the Wilds)

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.340
No need to look for the Serpent Immortal.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.840
I've already let her go.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:51.710
Who are you?

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.740
(Soul-eating Demon)
I am the ancient alien demon.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.000
They call me the Devourer.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.310
There's nothing I do not know.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.910
No secret escapes my grasp.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.520
Ah, the renowned Ms. Luo Cha.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.520
You've here for my disciple, right?

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:05.960
What a pity.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.400
That one who resembles Jin Li

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.840
is merely a Serpent Spirit
under my command.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.750
Not Ji Li.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.590
You're the one behind

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.560
the Serpent incident.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.630
Mortals are tangled with desires.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.480
I simply draw in their resentments
and refine them.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:23.590
What now?

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.390
Ms. Luo, even this is your concern?

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:34.920
If you've nothing to hide,

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.160
why skulk in the shadows?

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:43.790
As I expected,

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.160
you've been guarding
Jin Li's spirit body.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.830
My elder brother bears the duty

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.190
of uniting the immortals and demons.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.830
How could I let you disturb his resolve?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.430
Today, no matter who it is,

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.270
they must face death.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.720
Hear me out before you act.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.680
Jin Li is already gone.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.560
Jie Chuan used all his Memory Power

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.070
to turn her remnants into a fish bone.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.830
Now, by his side,

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.310
the one who ensnares his soul

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.750
is the fish bone host, Jin Li.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.360
Destroying this spirit body

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.070
would only clear the path for them.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.310
Your brother forsook
the Demon Realm for her,

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:30.950
lingering in Hunling City.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.360
Yet you still have time
to argue with me.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.270
Luo Cha,

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.830
if Ji Li and Jie Chuan
truly love each other,

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.480
the grand cause of the Demon Clan

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.560
will be utterly destroyed.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.800
(Most of Ji Li's wounds have healed.)

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.780
(Could it be that Jie Chuan saved him?)

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.880
Master,

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.390
you're injured.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.000
Is the Serpent Immortal formidable?

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.600
That creature

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.720
had some rare medicine.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.870
It kept me unconscious for two days.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.630
Ordinary spirits

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.240
would never dare draw power from us.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.190
This Serpent Immortal

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:38.750
is no small deal.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.720
She likely holds an unexpected trump card.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:43.370
Jie Chuan has been captured.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.000
We have a chance to break free.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.950
We must return to the Immortal Realm.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:48.590
Master.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.560
Jie Chuan risked himself to save you.

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.870
We can't leave him behind.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.000
Even the demons
values loyalty.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.190
Jie Chuan is the Demon Sovereign.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.920
Even if his Demonic Ether is damaged,

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.560
no one can truly harm him.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.160
Since ancient times,

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.070
demons are our enemies.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.990
We are destined to clash one day.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.240
Put saving him aside.

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.630
Even if the Serpent Immortal wounds him,

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.920
it would bring gain

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.120
for the entire Immortal Clan.

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.310
Jie Chuan healed most of my injury

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.600
from the strike
you accidentally dealt me.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.160
I owe him.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.840
Master,

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.560
the demons attacked the immortals

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.310
because they lack sunlight

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:42.430
and are troubled by Miasma.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.120
It is their struggle to survive.

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:45.950
Immortals and demons

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:48.560
don't have to be enemies, do we?

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.950
What has Jie Chuan been telling you?

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.430
We have always been in constant balance

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:58.630
for thousands

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:00.240
of years.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.310
You always taught me to repay gratitude

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.800
and to stay true to my word.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:07.360
Jie Chuan has shown us kindness.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.600
I intend to return

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.160
that kindness.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.360
What's that in your hand?

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.630
The Demon Pendant from Jie Chuan.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.440
Give it to me.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.640
Hand it over.

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.870
Ji Li.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:50.960
Master.

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:54.670
If Jie Chuan and I use our spiritual power,

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.320
I'll draw away his Demonic Ether.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.870
Why?

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:17.390
Ji Li,

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:18.720
remember this.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.270
In this world,

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:23.270
you'd be the last one
to fall under his sway.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.240
Nor can you betray the Immortal Clan.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.320
Today,

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:32.960
I will undo

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.870
the Soul-linking Arts between you two.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.030
But you must promise me,

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.080
from this day on,

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:42.790
you must sever all ties with Jie Chuan.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.000
I understand, Master.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.080
But Master,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.440
I stayed in Hunling City

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.200
not just to free Jie Chuan,

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.630
but to investigate something else.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.550
The Serpent Immortal in Hunling City

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.870
looks exactly like me.

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:07.750
Exactly the same?

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:14.510
If that's the case,

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.910
you should return even sooner.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.560
Tonight,

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:22.120
take time to rest.

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:23.510
Tomorrow,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.250
someone will come to escort you.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.320
Your Grace,

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:38.120
the Serpent Spirit in Hunling City

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.150
may be linked
to the Demon-subduing Immortal.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.630
I request to track down the whereabouts

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.550
of the Demon-Subduing Immortal.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:47.790
Granted.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.840
Has Jie Chuan

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.750
already had affections to Ji Li?

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:02.910
You know what to do.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.360
Our plan to vanquish demons

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:06.960
must not be neglected.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.280
No way.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.960
I can't just leave like this.

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:31.360
I don't think it's ugly.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:32.840
I just feel that

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.750
it's a bit conspicuous.

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:37.320
If you're concerned about the scales,

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.360
I have a way to help you.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.960
My manor's plants still need you.

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:55.440
I'll never let you be hurt again.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.430
The higher I throw it,
the more likely it comes true.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.560
Let me help.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.270
The higher it flies,

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:04.210
the stronger the wish.

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:05.670
Your wish right now

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:06.550
has reached the skies.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:43.670
(This is the Serpent Immortal Temple,
where Master was trapped.)

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.720
(Jie Chuan, wait for me.)

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.550
Lady Serpent Immortal,

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:53.270
why have you returned so early today?

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:56.550
Yes, a bit earlier than usual.

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:04.120
My Lady,

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.630
how is your power so frail right now?

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:12.320
Mind your tongue.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.150
I don't need you

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:15.360
to support me.

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:17.680
I crossed paths

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.320
with the unruly Ji Ling recently.

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:21.480
He was actually

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.120
an immortal from the Immortal Realm.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.120
I sought to subdue him

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.320
and spent my spiritual power.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:27.960
If memory serves,

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.120
he slipped away from your grasp.

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:32.160
I acknowledge my fault.

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:33.390
Since you do,

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.630
shouldn't you present the new Ji Ling?

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:37.320
I must replenish myself well.

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:40.320
Come, tidy things up.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.380
Prepare for the marriage.

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:44.920
The auspicious hour has come.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.120
Let the union ritual begin.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.720
May your affections be deep.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:52.310
May you be bound forever in one accord.

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:53.630
(This medicine)

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:55.120
(is unexpectedly forceful.)

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.550
(It could leave me weak for so long.)

00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.750
(It takes ten minutes more
to dispel it.)

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.490
(I wonder how Ji Li is doing.)

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.200
(Curse it.)

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:23.670
(My powers have yet to return.)

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.870
My Lady,

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:27.960
look there.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.400
That frail, delicate form

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.000
truly stirs pity.

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:33.670
It's a divine destiny.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.870
The ritual is completed.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.200
Congratulations, My Lady.

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:41.750
My Lady, this way please.

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:44.110
I can

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.390
manage alone.

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.510
All unrelated persons, withdraw.

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:48.710
My Lady,

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.510
you forgot your medicine.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.240
(Doesn't look like you're tortured.)

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:19.720
(Then why not run?)

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.480
(Wait to be wed
to the Serpent Spirit, huh?)

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:28.910
(How did the Demon Pendant
end up with her?)

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:31.030
(Has Ji Li been captured?)

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:34.390
(Didn't expect him to look this good.)

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:36.080
(No wonder the Serpent Spirit likes.)

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.600
(Insignificant spirit.)

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.240
(Once I regain strength,
I'll demand Ji Li's whereabouts.)

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.910
(Then I'll strip your skin.)

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:43.350
(Jie Chuan,)

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:45.390
(you gave me troubles
back in the Demon Realm.)

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:47.240
(Now that you're in my hands,)

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.720
(why not have a little fun?)

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:55.800
Step aside.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.200
(Why so fierce?)

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.120
(We're about to part ways.)

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.750
This is the finest Ji Ling chosen.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:04.670
Doesn't look all that impressive.

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:19.230
Today,

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:22.720
I'll make sure to treat you well.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.480
You're just a little snake,

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:25.720
not an immortal.

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:26.750
Insolence!

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.630
My beauty can captivate kingdoms.

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:30.790
My powers know no bounds.

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:32.590
To be cared for

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:34.550
is a blessing to you.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.030
You should be pleased.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.480
So, how do you want me

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:39.480
to serve you?

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:40.870
How about

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.150
planting flowers in this room

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:52.720
and tidying it up?

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:57.480
Most importantly,

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:05.920
it does feel rather pleasant.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.640
Why is this pillow cold and hard?

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:09.200
What are you doing?

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.030
What's wrong, My Lady?

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:13.350
Didn't you want me to serve you?

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:18.000
Then let's start with a cup of wine.

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:19.750
The night is already perfect.

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:22.670
Let's stay sharp.

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:25.510
Isn't that better?

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:52.260
♪Thin wisps of smoke weave

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:59.210
