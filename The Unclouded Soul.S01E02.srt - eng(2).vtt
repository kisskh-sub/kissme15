[The Unclouded Soul]

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.789
[Episode 2]

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:41.759
I haven't bathed in days,

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:42.710
and I haven't even relieved myself.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.000
I just smell sour and foul—

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.600
I wouldn't taste good at all.

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.920
Where did the half-demon blood in you

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.870
come from?

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.430
What half-demon?

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.039
I don't understand any of that.

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:55.650
I'm just a commoner.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.640
A demon hunter

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.960
can't be called a commoner.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.840
Those are all fake—

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.840
just ordinary coarse paper.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.300
If they were real,
you'd have reacted by now.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.150
You really do stink.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.470
Mm-hmm.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.000
In that case,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.590
I'll just have to find a rat demon
to eat you.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:16.400
No, no,

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.960
no, no, no—

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.240
Boss, Cat Boss,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.280
please don't eat me.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.280
You've seen me—

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.900
I have no demonic power.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.300
A swindler like you

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.010
is even less worthy of living.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.900
Stop!

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.590
Since you claim not to be a demon hunter,

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.870
what is your name?

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.780
Where is your home?

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.850
Is anyone else in your family?

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.920
My name is Xiao Yao.

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.630
It's just my father and me in my family.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.960
My father used to be a hunter in Wenling,

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.000
but then the magistrate's office
forced us to catch demons.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.150
W-We didn't know how to catch a demon,
and we didn't understand any of it.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.150
I had no choice

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.120
but to team up with some fellow villagers

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.280
to scam people—just to get by.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.090
What is your date of birth?

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.160
I don't know.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.870
I really don't know.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.710
My mother died
right after giving birth to me.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.800
My father said he just remembers

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.750
it was a winter night,

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.030
heavy snow falling,

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.030
and when the wind blew,
plum blossoms swirled into the room—

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.290
that's when I was born.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.840
Really, I'm not lying.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.800
What do you want from me?

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.490
Now

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.060
you can never lose me.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.710
No matter where I go,

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.720
no matter how many years pass—

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.600
you will always find me.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.079
If you must kill me, then kill me—

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.170
but do not dishonor me,

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.420
my lord demon.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.590
My Lord,

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.370
it seems she is not Ning'an.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.870
Please rest now

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.560
and leave

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.320
the rest to me.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.020
No need.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.720
My Lord,

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.710
she merely resembles Ning'an. That is all.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.510
Excuse me, have you all
come to an agreement?

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.310
Is it possible to release me now?

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.870
Thank you so much!

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.130
What a truly good soul—

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.450
no, a truly good demon!

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.730
Find two minor demons to guard her.

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:55.830
Once it's done,

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.950
come find me.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:57.680
Yes, My Lord.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.000
My Lord,

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.990
Ning'an is dead.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.270
Xiao Mu saw it with his own eyes.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.240
This woman

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.920
may seem unusual,

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.950
but I swear

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.600
she is not Ning'an.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:17.920
Switch to Xiao Mu.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.040
My Lord, you...

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.950
You...

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.770
I, Xiao Mu, am here, My Lord.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.510
Tell me everything

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.170
that happened after my death—

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.580
every detail, without missing a word.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.680
The best decision

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.800
I ever made in this life

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.870
was meeting you.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.090
After the crowd dispersed,

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.750
I retrieved your clothes—

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.120
still carrying a trace
of your primordial spirit—

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.660
intending to return to Demons' Valley
and preserve it with care.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.920
But by then, the demons in Demons' Valley

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.130
had already been slaughtered by humans.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.070
I had no choice but to seal your spirit

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.560
within an ancient tree deep in the heart
of Qingyuan Mountain.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.170
Drawing upon
the mountain's spiritual energy

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.159
and your cultivation,

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:44.830
it would have taken only 300 years

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.430
for you to regain human form.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.360
Over the years,

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.690
demons have been hunted
nearly to extinction by humans.

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.140
The survivors each
harbor their own agendas.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.840
I gathered those minor demons who hadn't
yet awakened their spiritual awareness

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.270
back to the one small corner
of Demons' Valley

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:58.950
that remained untouched,

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.460
trained them
to strengthen their power,

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.320
and prepared for your awakening.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.440
But just a century had passed,

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.570
and who could have foreseen

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.040
that this woman would
disturb your primordial spirit…

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.300
You have endured much.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.360
My Lord,

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.880
my life—Xiao Ming's too—

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.390
was given by you.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.160
Without you,

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.730
we would have remained stray cats,

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:24.720
abused and forgotten,

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.240
living out mere years in the human realm.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.970
So anything we do for you

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.530
is only what we ought to do.

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:35.300
It's just...

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.390
now that you have been forcibly awakened
before your time,

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:42.270
your three souls and seven spirits
have not yet fully returned.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.730
Your spiritual power
is greatly diminished

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.750
and will require daily cultivation

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:48.270
to restore it swiftly.

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.750
To regain my power rapidly,

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.240
the most effective way

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:58.460
is to find the Yuli Spring
before the humans do

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:01.190
and claim it for my own.

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:04.510
But to locate the Yuli Spring,

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:07.110
I still need the guidance
of the Kunlun Mirror.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.220
The ancient Kunlun Mirror

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.480
was shattered on the day of your wedding,

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.750
its fragments scattered
across the three realms.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.080
In these hundred years,

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.050
only you have ever succeeded
in finding pieces of the mirror.

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:20.070
Now, every clan is growing desperate
in their search for the Yuli Spring—

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:21.560
especially since your awakening

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.750
has also stirred the reappearance
of the Dreamshard.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.400
If you leave Demons' Valley now
to seek the mirror,

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.310
you will become a target for all.
It is far too dangerous.

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:30.240
We implore you

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.240
to remain in the valley
and recover your strength for now.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.940
My Lord, My Lord—

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:36.559
the human girl has escaped!

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:37.909
How could you let this happen?

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:39.240
Weren't you told
to keep a close watch on her?

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.000
How could she escape?

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.080
She said she needed to relieve herself.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.200
If we didn't let her out,

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.460
she threatened to do it right
in the room.

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:27.510
Hey, little ones,

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.370
why did you take my bag?

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.170
Tell your friends
to give it back to me.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.070
So this is your hideout?

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.630
How adorable...

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.960
Sorry about that,

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:29.630
um—

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.580
I'll fix it for you right now.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:35.790
Stop hitting me, and I'll fix it!

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:43.320
I'm really sorry!

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.380
I'll help repair this bridge for you.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:48.270
Looks like it can't really

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:49.580
be fixed after all…

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.200
Um, maybe you should fix it yourselves.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.660
W-Who told you
to snatch my bag first anyway?

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.920
Next time, I'll help you fix it properly.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.080
Um,

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.630
sorry, sorry—

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:16.630
it wasn't on purpose.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:17.360
I just

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.970
accidentally broke them,

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.920
but it was your little ones

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.050
who snatched my bag first!

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:32.440
Next time I have a chance,
I'll help you fix it for real!

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:35.750
Stop chasing me!

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.180
I already said I'd help you!

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:41.990
Demons, begone!

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.760
Blast you!

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.380
Blast you all!

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:47.840
Dad!

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.120
I'll blast you to pieces!

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.080
She disappeared right here.

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:22.510
My Lord,

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.020
there's no need to worry.

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:25.150
With her level of skill,

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.630
she could never breach the barrier
of Demons' Valley.

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.230
But given her level of skill,

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.570
she'd be in danger if she
encountered a demon with ill intentions.

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:34.230
It is time to gather all demons

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.290
back under my command.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.870
I finally found this place!

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.920
Until our paths cross again!

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:33.530
What's going on?

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:50.750
How unusual—

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.450
a being from another race
has actually entered Demons' Valley.

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:55.840
[Hei Wu]

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.500
How did you cross the barrier?

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.640
And how many others are with you?

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:07.130
All of you—stand down!

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:17.250
A century has passed,

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:19.520
Demon Lord, I trust you have been well.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.720
A century ago,
you were defeated by my hand.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.830
I ordered you to cultivate
in the Pipa Cave

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:25.840
and refrain from meddling
in demon affairs.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.680
Why have you left without permission?

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.650
Well, with the Demon Lord absent,

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.070
chaos spread among our demon kind.

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:32.850
I merely guarded this last stretch

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:35.050
of land in Demons' Valley in your stead.

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:43.800
Demon Lord,
congratulations on regaining human form.

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:45.230
Now that I have returned,

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:47.470
the demons shall be under my care again.

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:48.360
Come with me.

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:49.030
Not so fast.

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:51.930
This outsider girl

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.060
carries demon-repelling artifacts on her

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:55.720
and trespassed into Demons' Valley—

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.590
clearly she bears ill will
toward our demon kind.

00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:00.280
I, Hei Wu, dare not question
the Demon Lord,

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.720
but neither can I ignore a threat
to the demon kind.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.390
What would you have us do?

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.170
I didn't even want to come here—
I'll leave right now.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.220
How I act requires

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:18.240
no commentary from you.

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:19.600
Demon Lord,

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:23.120
mercy and softness will not
achieve great deeds.

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.550
Or perhaps your will
outruns your strength.

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:27.390
If you cannot ensure
the safety of Demons' Valley,

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:28.030
I, Hei Wu,

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.880
am willing to act in your stead,
Demon Lord.

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:53.150
The "great deed" you speak of

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:55.640
is nothing but the Yuli Spring.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.430
As your Demon Lord,

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:00.070
I will lead you to the spring

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:02.790
and help all demons
attain full power.

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:05.390
But if you harbor any other ambitions,

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:07.910
I'm happy to show you exactly

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.960
how ruthless I can be.

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:13.030
Yes, my Lord.

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:19.920
What—

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.790
do you still wish to stay among them?

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.930
Just now he clearly suffered damage
to his spiritual power,

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:38.790
yet he still...

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:40.730
Forgive my incompetence.

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:42.020
[Wu Huan]

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.480
Forgive my incompetence.

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:47.950
Hong Ye remains a force
to be reckoned with.

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:04.520
Are you hurt as well?

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:06.030
Why would I be hurt?

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:08.920
My Lord,

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:09.920
I…

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.480
I, Xiao Ming, will take my leave for now.

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:18.320
If you need anything,
please remember to call for me.

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:44.310
You—what are you doing?

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:45.200
Let go of me!

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:46.240
Let go!

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:46.880
Y-You…

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:48.590
I never expected the exalted Demon Lord

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:50.920
to stoop so low
as to bully an ordinary girl!

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.880
Are you truly an ordinary girl?

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.510
I…

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:54.590
you…

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:02.090
Fine, I am not an ordinary woman—

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:04.270
and I suggest you release me.

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:06.030
If you don't, then I'll—

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:08.790
You'll what?

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.440
Stop right there.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:21.960
As a demon,

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:23.890
yet knowing no demonic arts,

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:25.840
you should remain in Demons' Valley

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.370
and properly learn
to wield spiritual power.

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:31.640
That's ridiculous.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:34.160
I was perfectly fine in the human realm—

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.350
first dragged here for no reason,

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.680
and now you want me

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:38.880
to study demonic arts out of nowhere.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.110
I'm human.

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:41.590
You were able to awaken me,

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:43.710
which proves you are a demon,

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.640
not human.

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:47.720
The only reason
I've kept you alive until now

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.980
is because demon blood flows within you.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.270
You might

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:53.670
as well accept it—you are a demon.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:55.000
I was born of my mother

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:55.750
and raised by my father.

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:56.880
I am not a demon.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:58.830
Demons eat people—I don't.

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:00.700
Demons eat people—

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:01.770
Yet you do not.

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:06.990
Say that again.

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:11.590
Just

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:14.720
who are you?

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:31.220
Ning'an,

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:34.970
I have recovered the ancient Kunlun Mirror
for you.

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:36.480
All that came before

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.440
was merely to unsettle your mind.

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:42.240
Ning'an,

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:44.660
toward me,

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.100
have you ever felt anything true?

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:20.160
From this day forth,

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:23.990
you are forbidden
to leave Demons' Valley.

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:27.910
Take one step beyond it,
and you will be shown no mercy.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:33.550
Move!

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:46.270
My Lord!

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:48.110
It's nothing.

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:50.610
I sustained a minor injury

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:53.520
during the earlier clash with Hei Wu—
that is all.

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:12.480
Who are you?

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:13.670
I'm Luoluo,

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:13.830
[Luoluo]

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:14.750
and she's Dali.

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:15.790
The Lord sent us

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:17.350
to bring you something to eat.

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.880
Mm-hmm.

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:19.030
Eat up.

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:20.760
It's delicious.

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:29.750
[Dali]

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:36.700
Here, have some too.

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:39.490
He won't eat—he's not hungry.

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:43.160
Just you eat.

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:46.540
Then I won't eat either.

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:49.870
What's wrong?

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.060
It's poisoned, isn't it?

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:54.480
It's not poisoned. Eat.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.330
Enough now—put it down.

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.400
He's waiting for you outside.

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:17.840
Can I borrow something?

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.270
Borrow what?

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:36.640
Why are you dressed like that?

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.590
I've noticed you demons

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:39.250
always seem to aim for my neck.

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:41.680
Are your wounds any better?

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.410
I've recovered from the wound,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.480
but my body aches.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:47.200
That bed of yours is way too hard—

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.350
my back just can't…

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:49.550
But it's fine, really.

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:50.790
Just let me go

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:52.050
and the pain will stop.

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:56.480
Follow me.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:12.400
Do you know

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:15.450
that all living things possess a spirit?

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:17.160
I do.

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:18.960
Demons

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.920
are born from the cultivation
of all beings in this world.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.140
For a demon, the path of cultivation
is exceptionally difficult.

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:28.940
One must possess innate wisdom,

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:31.510
draw upon the essence
of heaven and earth,

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:33.510
follow the laws of nature's cycles,

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:36.950
endure countless seasons and moons—

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:39.650
only then may one take human form.

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:41.160
Even so,

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:44.010
they must still evade pursuit

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.120
from both humans and their own kind.

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:52.110
Are you going to tell me the history
of Demons' Valley?

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:56.820
I want you to understand

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:59.170
that the demon race, like human race,

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:01.300
is also a unique part of this world.

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:04.070
You're right.

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:07.790
But I'm still human, not a demon.

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:10.250
That's a distinction
that can't be blurred.

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:15.680
Whatever you believe,

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:19.510
you are ultimately different
from other humans.

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:21.480
People will not accept demons—

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.360
and they will not accept you.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.180
Now that you've entered Demons' Valley,

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:29.980
you already carry an aura
of demonic energy that cannot be cleansed.

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:32.360
How is that possible?

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:33.720
Don't lie to me—

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:35.520
how could I have demonic energy?

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:36.680
Then tell me,

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.270
Then tell me: why did Luoluo and Dali

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:40.960
not recognize you as human?

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:47.850
Humans will see you as an aberration—

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:49.010
they will fear you,

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:50.790
scorn you,

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:52.720
and even seek your death.

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:55.080
What if the one I'm about to kill

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:56.550
is a demon?

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.050
She is not a demon.

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:01.190
Many people came to my home,
splashed dog blood,

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:05.200
drove us from place to place—
hunted and reviled wherever we went.

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.360
Don't talk as if you know humans so well.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.180
Better than you humans know yourselves.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.550
As the ruler of all demons,

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:36.230
I am also responsible for the lives
of every demon under my charge.

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:37.270
If you leave,

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:39.440
the demons will believe

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:42.470
Demons' Valley
has been exposed to danger.

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:44.480
That is why I will not let you go.

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:47.140
Let me offer you

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.830
well-meant advice:
accept my proposal gladly,

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:52.450
settle here in Demons' Valley.

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:54.110
I will arrange lessons for you

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.070
so you may soon cultivate spiritual power

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:58.270
and learn to conceal your demonic aura.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.100
After that,

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:03.140
both the demon realm and the human realm
will be open to you.

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:05.590
And if I insist on leaving?

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:09.980
Suit yourself.

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:28.920
Hello, everyone.

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:34.010
Don't attack. Don't attack.

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:39.190
I'm Xiao Yao.

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:40.730
Last time was my fault—

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:43.520
I accidentally damaged your place,

00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:45.390
but I'm here to make up for it now.

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:47.350
Really, I mean it.

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:49.110
Look, I've even brought tools.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:50.820
The bridge.

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:56.520
Well, I'll be staying here
for a few days.

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.110
Since fate has brought us together,

00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:00.000
how about we get along peacefully?

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:00.590
Alright,

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:02.070
come over and give it a try.

00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:10.510
You know, I noticed

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:12.240
something's missing around here.

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:14.240
This time I'll build you a fence too—

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.120
that'll make things even safer.

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:24.440
Sorry, sorry—

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.240
that wasn't on purpose, really!

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:27.750
Who built your house last time anyway?

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:28.960
It's not very sturdy.

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:31.070
But don't worry—now that I'm here,

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:32.400
I'll make sure your home

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.660
won't budge even in wind

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:34.740
or rain.

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:32.680
There, all done…

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:36.880
Alright, good.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.410
From now on, we're friends!

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:41.400
Do they have names?

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:43.170
Zhuyu herb.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:44.650
Zhuyu herb?

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:47.350
That sounds like the name of a plant.

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:50.810
Zhuyu herb originally grew
as spirit herb on Mount Zhaoyao.

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:52.640
That land is harsh and cold,

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:55.640
making cultivation there
extremely difficult.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.960
Yet Zhuyu herb possesses
remarkable properties—

00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:01.560
if humans consume it, they can go 7 days
without hunger or thirst.

00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:03.640
Because of that, in this world,

00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:08.240
the Zhuyu herb has been driven nearly
to extinction by human overharvesting.

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:13.090
Only these few remain,

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:15.730
having fled to Demons' Valley

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.050
to escape becoming human sustenance.

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:22.610
So you're edible.

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.890
If you apply yourself in your lessons,

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:34.070
you may return to the human realm

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:35.070
in just a few days.

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.570
Whew, just on time.

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:05.890
Why are you taking my spot again?

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:08.440
Get out of here!

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.030
You get out!

00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:09.830
Move over already.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:11.240
Go, go!

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:12.030
Who are you cheering for?

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:12.830
Come on!

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:13.640
Try one.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.120
Do I really have to be
in the same class as these guys?

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:16.680
[Bamboo]

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:17.830
So sour.

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:18.720
That can't be right.

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.860
Try another piece.

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:30.090
What are you doing?

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.550
Just making sure you're not late.

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:31.960
I...

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:32.510
Look,

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.640
the crane's still flying.

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:37.660
You lot who can fly—

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:38.890
and live close by—

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.550
why can't you ever come early?

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:41.950
You are always late.

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:43.240
Don't you feel guilty?

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.370
Aren't you ashamed?

00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:52.440
It's your fault for having to eat—

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.270
now we're late!

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:54.720
If you don't eat,
how do you have the strength to study?

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:55.510
Here, take it.

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:56.200
Xiao Yao!

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.030
you're here! Come over.

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:00.640
You're early!

00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:01.600
Give me the book.

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:02.790
This—

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:03.590
This is yours.

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:04.920
Right, this is your seat.

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:05.680
This is mine.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.000
-And this is Luoluo's seat.
-This is mine.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.460
Everyone, gather around!

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:10.810
-Hurry, hurry!
-We have a new classmate.

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.600
Come over!

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:12.800
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.790
You're all still

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.830
minor demons
who haven't fully taken human form.

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:18.400
Mm-hmm.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:19.570
Mm-hmm.

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:23.680
I told you this would hold me back!

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:25.110
I've said so to the Lord—

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:26.350
but he insisted I be

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:27.550
in the same class as you.

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:29.160
We really shouldn't be classmates.

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.690
Or maybe you're just afraid
to be in our class—

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.790
afraid we'll find out

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:41.070
the Lord has been granting you
private tutelage.

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:42.240
Yeah, for sure—

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.160
extra lessons behind our backs.

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:43.590
Right,

00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:44.070
definitely.

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:44.720
I knew it.

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:47.160
We've been training for years
and still look like this.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.550
Sweating now, aren't you?

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:49.640
What kind of demon are you anyway?

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:52.350
Yes, if we can't even tell your true form,
something's off.

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:53.070
Look!

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:56.720
My true form

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:57.720
is

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.160
a white snake.

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:01.950
A Snake?

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:05.160
It was a night of falling blossoms.

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.730
I was lost in the forest,

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:09.960
hunted by human trappers.

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:11.710
At the most perilous moment,

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:15.640
a hero in blue robes descended
from the heavens

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.370
and saved me from certain doom.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:25.450
A hero in blue robes…

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:26.480
Could that be the Lord?

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.960
Shh!

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:31.070
The Lord told me not to speak of it—
so don't ask more.

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:31.720
We can't say that. We can't.

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:33.510
Xiao Yao,

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:36.550
that mouth of yours
certainly doesn't go to waste.

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.340
Can't stop boasting, can you?

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:40.160
True.

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:41.310
Right?

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:44.030
My Lord.

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.920
Do you have something to do?

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:48.510
I—well, yes.

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:51.000
I was just worried the Lord
might be concerned,

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.930
so I came specially to check and see

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:54.340
if she was holding her own.

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:55.750
With that sharp tongue of hers,

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:56.750
why would I worry?

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.510
If you are not worried,

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:03.070
then why come here

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:05.000
instead of cultivating properly?

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:13.030
My Lord—

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:14.520
I'm sorry! My Lord!

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:16.550
Please put me down, My Lord!

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.520
You're a white snake?

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:21.300
Mm-hmm.

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:24.170
Then can I give you something?

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:26.170
A welcoming gift?

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:31.960
You don't like it?

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:35.469
I do,

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.320
but I've quit that.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.190
Nowadays I only eat humans.

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:41.199
You eat humans!

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:42.230
Y-You eat humans?

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:43.190
You're amazing!

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:44.030
She actually eats humans!

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:46.190
Only Xiaohu's father once ate humans.

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:46.710
Mm-hmm.

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:47.570
right.

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:53.230
Hey, you! Talk properly.

00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:55.280
Well, my dad said

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:56.320
human flesh

00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:57.360
is sour—

00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:59.130
doesn't taste good at all.

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:00.480
It's just nothing special.

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.070
Right?

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:03.230
Your father doesn't care
for eating humans.

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:04.210
Of course not.

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:05.590
My dad also said

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:06.630
they just

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.880
act fierce and scary

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:10.140
to intimidate humans.

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:11.730
Humans are terrifying.

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:12.800
Yes, that's right.

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.130
I remember my mom saying

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:15.670
humans eat everything raw or cooked—

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:17.190
anything can end up in their mouths.

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.880
True.

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:20.480
Lots of demons have
ended up in human stomachs.

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:21.110
Yeah,

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:22.710
and they eat us the most!

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:24.230
Right, and they have
so many ways to cook us…

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:25.710
Stir-fried, boiled…

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.840
Don't scare yourselves like that.

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.190
Actually, humans

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:30.760
don't just eat demons.

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:33.290
-They eat lots of things.
-The Master's here.

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:34.760
Now,

00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:36.840
I have a question for you.

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:40.070
Who knows what

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:42.960
the true form of a Bi Fang is?

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:48.360
Who...

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:49.740
Xiao Yao,

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:50.260
you answer.

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:51.210
[King of Eight Plates]

00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:58.020
Still not ready?

00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.150
Don't rush.

00:35:59.150 --> 00:36:01.840
Softshell turtle soup needs
to simmer even longer.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:02.900
Softshell turtle?

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:04.290
Where'd you get it?

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:06.390
Our master is a turtle, isn't he?

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:09.910
Sir.

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:10.920
Sir.

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.210
The Master is gone.

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:14.320
No,

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:16.360
I just snipped a bit of his beard

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.800
while he was asleep.

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:20.440
If there's a next time,

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:23.170
I will banish you
from Moon-Gazing Terrace.

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:26.590
Goodbye, Master.

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:35.050
Dali, you're so delicious.

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:36.750
Don't talk nonsense—

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:38.400
this is a flower pastry Xiao Yao made

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.510
from fallen petals.

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:40.320
Is it tasty?

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:41.320
Mmm, it's delicious.

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:42.000
Delicious.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:42.620
Tasty.

00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:46.760
A simple trick.

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:47.550
It smells nice, doesn't it?

00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:48.500
So sweet.

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:49.860
Here, have a taste.

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:51.520
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.000
I-I—

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:55.080
you have so many here…

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.330
today I-I'll...

00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:58.610
I'll...

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:04.610
Little deer,

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.730
are you willing to offer
a small piece of your antler?

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:08.460
Alright.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:09.360
You—

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:11.840
just tell me where the bird's nest is,
that's enough.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.070
Can I use this instead?

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:13.850
Sure.

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:15.540
Genuine wolf-hair brush.

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.190
Then I'll roll it.

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:20.050
Roll it! Roll it! Roll it!

00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:21.450
Roll it! Roll it! Roll it!

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.030
Deer antler,

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:26.670
wolf-hair brush,

00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:27.800
lingzhi mushrooms—

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.410
my father will be overjoyed
when he finds out.

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:39.480
Ginseng boy,

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:41.760
we're rich!

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:50.480
Little one,

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:53.860
are you playing here by yourself?

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.950
You're so adorable—

00:37:58.190 --> 00:38:00.000
let me tie a red string on you.

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:01.400
Good boy.

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:02.400
Here we go.

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.400
So pretty.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:16.290
There, all done.

00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:22.760
Thank you, lady.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.510
These red strings are for you—

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:27.110
to give to your destined one.

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:33.800
Isn't it said
that if you tie a red string on it,

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:35.150
it turns into ginseng?

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:39.960
So polite, though.

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:46.020
Xiao Yao,

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:47.000
I've prepared—

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.150
Sorry, wrong room.

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.130
This seems to be my room.

00:38:58.670 --> 00:38:59.320
I prepared

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:01.320
something for you.

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:16.030
This—

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:18.030
a bright-red gauze canopy?

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:20.070
Why does it look like part of a dowry?

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:25.350
Don't all young girls

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.060
like things like this?

00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:29.030
Who's a "young girl"?

00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:30.420
I'm not young!

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:32.320
I've lived for over a thousand years.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.560
Compared to me,

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.660
aren't you a young girl in my eyes?

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:38.030
Fair point…

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:40.440
You old demon.

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:42.940
Demon Lord,

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:44.770
the Eternal Demon Lord.

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:46.880
Here,

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:50.670
I'll give you something in return—

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:52.480
you're welcome.

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:53.090
Stop!

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:01.560
Xiao Yao,

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.600
do you realize what you've done?

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:06.630
Why did that red string disappear?

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.480
That's not something you wear

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.880
or give away so casually.

00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:11.630
It's not an ordinary red string—

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:14.830
it's the red matchmaking thread
of the red-thread demon.

00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:16.710
Then why was it on Ginseng boy?

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:18.310
I'll go find him to undo it.

00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:19.710
Stay right where you are!

00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:21.970
That's not "Ginseng boy"—

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:23.920
it's the red-thread demon's
second generation disciple.

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:27.980
Alright, alright, the red-thread demon's
second generation disciple.

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:29.770
Why are you following me?

00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:43.350
Now do you understand
why I'm following you?

00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:48.960
Could it be that this red string

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:50.540
won't let us separate?

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:52.760
It's more than just not separating.

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.710
The red matchmaking thread
of the red-thread demon

00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:57.910
is created for romance between demons.

00:40:58.630 --> 00:40:59.760
It has three stages.

00:41:00.590 --> 00:41:02.520
Only after all three are completed

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:04.030
can it dissolve on its own.

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:05.590
What are the three stages?

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:06.880
First stage:

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:09.640
The two connected by the red thread

00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:12.340
cannot be more than ten feet apart.

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:13.110
Ten feet?

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.990
Second stage:

00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:23.200
They will share feelings and sensations.

00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:25.800
Feelings and sensations.

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:28.640
-What's the third stage?
-Don't worry—

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:30.770
we won't make it to the third stage.

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:31.710
Why?

00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:34.150
You're not going to eat me, are you?

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:35.100
My Lord,

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:37.070
the cleansing ceremony
to welcome Demon Lord

00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:38.230
has been prepared.

00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:39.290
Prepare to depart.

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:40.800
Where to?

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:43.030
After you, my Lord.

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:47.090
My Lord,

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:48.550
the cleansing ceremony
is no small matter.

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:50.190
You cannot take Xiao Yao with you.

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:50.710
Let go—

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:53.250
you, let go.

00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:58.960
I have made my decision.
Do not bring it up again.

00:41:58.960 --> 00:41:59.490
Let's go.

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:01.040
My Lord!

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:03.960
My Lord,

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:07.510
first you risked yourself
to save her from Hei Wu,

00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:09.760
then you sent her to Moon-Gazing Terrace
to study and cultivate.

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:12.630
You even prepared gauze canopies
and bedding for her—

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:13.190
and now,

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:15.960
do you want her to serve you personally?

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:18.510
You are the Monarch of All Demons.

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:19.440
Acting like this

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:21.480
could undermine your authority.

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:22.680
You think I want this?

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:23.710
If it weren't for us…

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:24.510
You—be quiet.

00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:28.790
And you—be quiet too.

00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.960
My Lord, the auspicious hour has arrived.

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:02.420
All unrelated personnel, please withdraw.

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.140
For today's ceremony,

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:07.800
Xiao Yao shall attend me.

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:12.520
You may instruct her.

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:35.260
First: Fragrant herbs

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:37.340
to clear away impurities.

00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:47.880
Xiao Yao! Xiao Yao!

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:17.000
M-My lord!

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:19.280
Continue.

00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:22.640
Second: Bathe in holy water

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:23.880
to wash away calamity.

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:24.590
Water?

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:30.900
I can do this.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:31.440
Good.

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:34.800
This water needs—

00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:39.320
Next?

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:41.760
Hmmm...

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:45.230
Keep going.

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:51.060
Third: Wield the willow branch
for fortune and longevity.

00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:57.440
Wield.

00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:03.070
Really?

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:03.800
Mm-hmm.

00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:14.960
Forgive me, my Lord!

00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:16.520
Withdraw.

00:45:17.590 --> 00:45:18.070
My Lord.

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:19.250
I said withdraw!

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:20.960
No, I mean—weren't you bound to me—

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:21.490
To wield,

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:23.190
not to strike.

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:23.760
Right, then—

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:24.960
the c-cleansing ceremony is concluded.

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:25.440
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:26.960
Let's go! Move it! Hurry up!

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:27.820
Run, let's run!

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:31.000
I don't know how to do this!

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.030
You're forcing me into something
I've never done—

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:35.400
I've never waited on anyone in my life.

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:37.400
Even though my family was poor
when I was little,

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:39.650
we never had to serve others like this.

00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:28.030
All hail the return of the Demon Lord
to the realm of the living!

00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:32.220
All hail the return of the Demon Lord
to the realm of the living!

00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:36.030
All hail the return of the Demon Lord
to the realm of the living!

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:40.440
All hail the return of the Demon Lord
to the realm of the living!
