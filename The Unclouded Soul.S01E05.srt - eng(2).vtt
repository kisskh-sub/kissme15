[The Unclouded Soul]

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.830
[Episode 5]

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.550
And what are you here for?

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.700
To present a blade.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.250
Sister, look. He looks like...

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.680
Be careful, miss.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.520
This blade drinks blood.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.039
He made it sound quite mysterious.

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.900
Hey, young man.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.560
The precious blade the patron wants
is here.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.810
If you know what's good for you, get lost!

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.140
Miss, please take me to present the blade.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.500
Stop.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.680
This guy knows demonic arts!

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.010
Get that blade from him!

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.470
Can I present my blade now?

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.060
Hero,

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.240
the patron is waiting in the main chamber.

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:42.910
Hero,

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.880
you don't look like an ordinary man.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.680
If this truly is a demon-slaying blade,

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.590
after you get your reward,

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.190
don't forget to let us

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.160
share a bit of your good fortune.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.800
I heard you are offering a hefty sum
to acquire a demon-slaying blade.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.330
I have come to present mine.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.360
Inspect it.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.150
It's you?

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:57.940
Was it Hong Ye

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.560
who sent you to take my blade?

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:03.560
What did Hong Ye

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.080
do to you

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.900
to make you obey his every word

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.240
and even forget that you were once human?

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:17.760
Master Bingzhu,

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.470
let me be honest with you.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.430
During my time in the Demons' Valley,

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.190
it was the demons who fed me, clothed me,

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.970
and gave me shelter.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.950
Anyone with eyes, a heart,
and a brain knows that

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.600
those minor demons
who have just taken human form

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.040
and are newly sentient

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.170
are no different from human children.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.750
They never leave the Demons' Valley,

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.390
cultivating and playing there.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.860
Their nature is kind.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.590
Not only have they never hurt me,

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.450
but they have also brought me joy.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.260
Yet some people

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.120
judge all demons as guilty
and deserving of death

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.240
because of the evil deeds of a few.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.260
How is that fair?

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.159
It seems those demons
have truly brainwashed you.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.640
Fine, let me ask you.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.130
Have you ever seen a demon
devour a human with your own eyes?

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.980
I have seen such bloody scenes

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.480
many times.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.080
Anyway,

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.960
if it weren't for that day

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.720
when you sent me to Qingyuan Mountain,

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.270
none of what followed would have happened.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.920
Xiao Yao.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.080
I know you're sharp-tongued.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.070
But I also know you have a pure heart.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.120
What exactly happened
after you fell off the cliff

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.380
at Qingyuan Mountain?

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.610
I want you to tell me everything
in detail,

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.630
without a single lie.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.480
That day when I fell off the cliff,

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.040
I thought I was done for.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.900
But suddenly,

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.000
a person appeared from the sky.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:00.410
That's all?

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:01.630
Yes.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.760
I have told you everything that happened

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.710
before you stepped into this room.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.340
Just now while you were speaking,

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.160
my sword didn't move at all.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.980
It shows it trusts you.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:16.200
So I trust you too.

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.040
Why does this blade seem alive?

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.560
Did you cast a spell on it,

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.750
or was something added

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.120
when it was forged?

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:34.830
It's not a blade.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.560
It's a person.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.340
A person who was killed
by a demon.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.180
Her soul was bound to this blade.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.920
She wants me to slay
all evil demons in the world with her.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.390
Tell me more.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:55.830
Our family served in the military

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.120
for generations.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.560
But my father was framed by villains,

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.820
reduced to a commoner,

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.670
and soon died of depression.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.270
His greatest wish was for me

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.470
to return to the army,

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.190
clear our family's name,

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.600
and serve the court.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.390
Since then,
my sister and I have relied on each other.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:13.800
Bingzhu.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.040
I practiced our family's blade techniques
every day,

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.570
hoping to fulfill
my father's last wish soon.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.680
Didn't you promise me
you wouldn't go again?

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.210
Let's go.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.210
But Bingzhu,
there are so many taxes these days.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:30.870
If I don't help you earn money,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.330
when will you save enough
to buy the blade?

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:34.909
Martial skills don't depend on the weapon.

00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:35.680
Wait for me here.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.040
Okay.

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:40.430
Give me your hand.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:45.430
But Bingzhu,

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.820
every time you pass the blacksmith shop,

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:51.040
your eyes lock onto that...

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:52.980
that blade inside.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.610
I've noticed it every time.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:56.290
No, I don't.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.370
The court requires

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.950
that you bring your own weapon

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:02.680
to be eligible to join the army.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:03.720
Bingzhu,

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.630
with your martial skills,

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:08.190
you'll surely become a general
if you join the army.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:09.320
Consider this money

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.750
a loan from me.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.790
Just pay me back double in the future,
General.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.920
When I become a general,

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:23.040
I'll buy you the finest clothes.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:24.920
We'll live in the finest house.

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:25.680
Mm-hmm.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.440
And by then,

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:30.800
I should also find you

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.330
the most virtuous husband.

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:33.750
Bingzhu!

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.240
You're home?

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:38.320
That's perfect.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.360
Mr. Song?

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.510
We've already paid the rent
and contributions.

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:41.960
Yes,

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.549
you paid the previous ones,

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:45.360
but new contributions have been assigned.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.800
Spring plowing is coming,

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.120
but Heaven
hasn't given a single drop of rain.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.270
Our neighbors around the nearby villages

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:53.510
want to pitch in to find a bride
for Lord Locust Tree

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:54.440
to pray for rain.

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:57.440
We have no money.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:00.080
It's a mandatory contribution.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.480
There's nothing I can do.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:02.510
Come on.

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:05.720
Bingzhu! Bingzhu!

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.320
What are you doing?

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:06.850
Bingzhu!

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.690
Don't move.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:09.840
Don't do anything.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:10.600
-You'll make trouble if you do anything.
-Bingzhu.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.750
Let Tan'er go!

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.500
Just a routine search.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.120
Every household says they have no money.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.450
How am I supposed to report
to my superior?

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:19.410
Search.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.000
Okay!

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.760
Tan'er, don't be afraid.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.240
Yes, search that chicken coop.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:25.750
Okay.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:30.320
Bingzhu! Bingzhu!

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.080
Bingzhu! Bingzhu!

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.000
That's enough.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:38.360
Alright, alright.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.820
There's still some money?

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:43.240
Well, why bother?

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.390
Bingzhu! Bingzhu!

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.250
Bingzhu!

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.940
Bingzhu, are you alright?

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:49.960
Keep it for firewood.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.220
So it won't go to waste.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.370
Let's go.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:54.080
Does it hurt?

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.360
Did they hurt you?

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.600
Song!

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:04.200
Bingzhu!

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:06.240
Don't go!

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.030
Don't go!

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.000
Don't go!

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:11.200
I'm fine. I'm fine.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.100
I'm fine.

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:14.320
Don't go.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:19.910
Really, I'm fine.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.840
It's me...

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:22.240
I'm the one

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:25.940
who put you through this.

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:29.170
No, no.

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:55.000
Bingzhu.

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:57.840
It's late.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.840
Go get some sleep.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.720
I need to prepare a few more goods

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.120
to deliver to Mr. Li's residence tomorrow.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.500
You go to bed first.

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:19.860
We can always earn more money.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:24.370
But if you hurt someone in a fight,

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:28.360
you'll never be eligible to join the army.

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.190
I won't get into a fight.

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:42.080
Get up.

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:48.510
Go to bed. Did you hear me?

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:49.960
Bingzhu.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:50.630
Sleep well.

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:52.710
Be a good girl.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.360
I'll finish those things

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.490
and then go to sleep.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:19.930
Bingzhu...

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:37.870
Tan'er?

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:41.390
Tan'er?

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.000
Tan'er!

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:23.080
Your sister

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:24.330
came early this morning.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:25.680
She paid 20 taels of silver

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.930
to buy this blade

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.580
and asked me to tell you

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.450
that she only signed a contract

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:32.080
to sell herself as a servant
to the landlord

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.680
in East Village for 10 years,

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:35.180
with food and lodging provided.

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:35.980
And she said

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:37.910
you should take the blade
and join the army,

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:39.170
achieve great things,

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.510
and not worry about her.

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:42.750
May I see the silver Tan'er used

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:43.960
to buy the blade?

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:50.390
Song!

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:52.760
Where is my sister?

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:54.780
Tan'er is a good girl.

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:56.510
She came to me this morning

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:58.930
and said she was willing to marry
Lord Locust Tree voluntarily.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:01.440
She took the betrothal money
and has already been sent to the wedding.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.500
You bastard!

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:05.000
Tan'er!

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.460
Tan'er!

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.550
Tan'er!

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:08.700
Tan'er!

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:36.610
Tan'er!

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:49.910
Bingzhu?

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:52.080
Bingzhu?

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:54.270
-Tan'er.
-Run!

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:56.000
Bingzhu, run!

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.360
Don't worry about me!

00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.550
Bingzhu!

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:00.720
Bingzhu!

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.600
Bingzhu!

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.570
Tan'er!

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:07.750
Bingzhu!

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:12.790
Bingzhu!

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:14.550
Bingzhu!

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:20.390
Bingzhu!

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:30.880
Tan'er.

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:32.110
Tan'er!

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.440
Tan'er, don't be afraid.

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:51.200
I'm coming to save you.

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:52.000
Tan'er!

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:57.750
Tan'er?

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:01.790
Bingzhu,

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:03.680
I...

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:07.730
I... can stay with you forever now.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:11.510
Tan'er.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:13.680
Tan'er, don't go! Tan'er!

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:16.510
Tan'er!

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.180
Tan'er!

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.790
Tan'er...

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.550
Tan'er!

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:41.590
The last soul
of Tan'er's three souls and seven spirits

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.160
was bound to this blade,

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:46.690
turning it into a demon-slaying blade.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.400
Later, I joined the army,

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:51.870
was assigned to the Feiyu Guard,

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.930
and rose through the ranks
to where I am today.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:56.880
That is why my sister and I

00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.600
have a blood feud with the demons.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.790
My sister has quite a temper.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.270
Only when she senses the demon
she wants to slay

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:10.730
will she leave the sheath.

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:12.140
Once drawn,

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:15.970
she will not return until
she has drunk her fill of demon blood.

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:18.110
But she's seen you several times

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.600
and never made a move.

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:23.540
That proves
that even though you have become a demon,

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:25.600
your nature remains pure.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.070
How touching.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:31.920
What?

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:35.070
Nothing. Please continue.

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:40.360
So I've been thinking that,

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:42.590
since Tan'er trusts you so much,

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:44.840
you should take her with you

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:46.500
to find Hong Ye.

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:50.500
Only when her long-cherished wish
is fulfilled

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.960
will Tan'er's
three souls and seven spirits return,

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.890
allowing her to reenter
the cycle of reincarnation.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:59.230
What is her long-cherished wish?

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:01.860
To eliminate all evil demons in the world.

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.840
Once Tan'er encounters Hong Ye,

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.320
I will appear at once.

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:10.400
That will be the best chance

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.530
to kill the Demon King once and for all.

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:16.910
Hong Ye and the demons in the
Demons' Valley are not evil demons.

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.700
Do you know what he did 100 years ago?

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.270
I don't know,

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.050
and I don't need to know.

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:31.790
You didn't witness

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.030
what happened 100 years ago yourself.

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:35.760
On what grounds do you conclude
that Hong Ye is...

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.330
According to the records,

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:41.350
he once bewitched Princess Ning'an.

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:43.570
He killed many people back then.

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:47.350
The court had to expend the strength
of the entire realm to seal him away.

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:48.140
Xiao Yao.

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:50.390
Have you got up?

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:52.160
Anyway,

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.070
Tan'er has never

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:55.350
trusted anyone but me.

00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:59.550
Don't let her down.

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:02.540
Xiao Yao!

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:07.880
Xiao Yao,

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:08.860
look.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.730
Do you notice any changes in me?

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.030
Well... It's...

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:14.720
My face.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.230
My skin.

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.720
Softer and fairer.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.270
Really?

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.960
It actually works!

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:22.130
Here's one for you.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.900
Isn't this that blade?

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.290
Where did you get it?

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.160
Money can solve anything.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.200
This blade looks quite impressive.

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:33.330
Oh my goodness!

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:34.940
Why is it so fierce?

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:36.470
Is it going to kill me?

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:37.970
You haven't done any evil.

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:39.110
It won't kill you.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.070
Master Blade,

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:42.570
we bear no grudge,

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.120
and I mean no offense.

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.370
Let's get along peacefully, shall we?

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:48.240
Where's Luoluo?

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.270
Luoluo!

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:50.720
Luoluo!

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:52.390
We should go now.

00:22:58.550 --> 00:22:59.880
What are you doing here?

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:03.440
Xiao Yao, he's here.

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:05.590
What's wrong?

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:10.250
What's wrong with Luoluo?

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:13.670
Yueyue is missing.

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:15.110
Yueyue?

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:16.830
Who is Yueyue?

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:18.030
My friend.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.680
I've searched the building, the courtyard,

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.830
the woodshed, the kitchen—everywhere,

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:24.030
but she's nowhere to be found.

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:25.610
Even her scent is gone.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.440
They all say she ran away,

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.970
but I know she wouldn't.

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:32.480
She would never leave behind
the grasshopper I gave her.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.120
Flower Lady,

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.650
I told you not to wander off.

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.500
Flower Lady,

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:44.670
you'll catch cold like this.

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:47.170
Flower Lady, don't be afraid.

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:49.070
Flower Lady,

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.730
where are you? Flower Lady?

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.840
Flower Lady?

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:57.210
Flower Lady, don't be afraid.

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:00.090
Flower Lady.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.410
Don't be afraid.

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:04.610
Don't be afraid.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:11.720
How's it going?

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:12.640
We couldn't find her.

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:12.880
Nothing.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:13.640
Keep looking! Hurry!

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:14.300
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:26.440
My Lord?

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:28.690
What happened?

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.130
Where is your blade?

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:31.590
I sold it.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.830
Where's the cartload of gold?

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:35.760
Do you need us to help bring it back?

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.110
Cartload... and gold?

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.510
Put the words "cartload" and "gold"
together and you get "slay".

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:46.440
The demon-slaying blade has gone
to take the Demon King's head.

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:47.640
Once the deed is done,

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.410
the court's rewards
will surely come to all of us.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.090
What's going on?

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:55.510
Oh right.

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:57.570
My Lord, the magistrate's office...

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:01.550
The magistrate's office is in chaos.

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:02.960
The daughter of the Qionghua Sect's leader
is missing.

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.400
They've stormed
the magistrate's office demanding her.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.040
They're about to tear the place down.

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.410
[Righteousness]

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:17.330
My junior sister disappeared
in your Pingjiang Prefecture.

00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:18.870
If anything happens to her,

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.180
I will make sure
your entire Pingjiang knows no peace.

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:24.190
If she is not found today,

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:25.920
your magistrate's office

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:26.750
will be torn down.

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:27.350
Yes!

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:28.940
Tear it down!

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:29.680
Everyone.

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:32.110
Young heroes!

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:34.320
As you can all see,

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.160
right now, in this main hall
of the magistrate's office,

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.220
there isn't a single constable left.

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:40.570
They've all been sent out to look for her.

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:42.310
I'm just a low-rank official.

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:44.640
Please don't make things difficult for me.

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:47.110
I've already sent someone to fetch
the Demon Slayer of the Feiyu Guard

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:48.350
to take charge of this matter.

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:49.410
He'll be here soon.

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:50.550
Very soon.

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:52.110
Please calm down.

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:53.130
Calm down.

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:53.640
Please remain...

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.750
Don't try to intimidate me
with an official.

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:56.960
It's the same whoever comes.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:57.720
How dare you!

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.640
This is an official government office.

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:23.830
How dare you cause trouble here?

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:36.170
Are you the one in charge?

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:38.480
I am Bingzhu of the Feiyu Guard.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.230
We are disciples of the Qionghua Sect.

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:45.080
Leader Jin's only daughter

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.510
went missing this morning in Pingjiang

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:48.640
without a trace.

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:51.000
We're here to report her disappearance.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.030
The report should be filed by the family.

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:56.290
Whoever lost their daughter
should speak for themselves.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.400
All others,

00:26:59.070 --> 00:26:59.790
get out!

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:22.440
Step back!

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:27.620
Take a seat.

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.070
No need.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.160
Since we're here to file a report,

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:34.880
we'll do it according to the procedures
of the magistrate's office.

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:35.480
Speak.

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:39.040
My Lord,

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:41.440
I am Jin Muqing,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.600
leader of the Qionghua Sect.

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:45.350
This is my wife.

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:47.510
I have a daughter

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.750
named Yunyi

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.650
who has been blind since birth.

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.240
We came to Pingjiang with our disciples

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:55.590
to eliminate demons

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:56.720
and uphold justice.

00:27:57.270 --> 00:28:00.000
Our daughter insisted on coming with us,

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.730
and we could not refuse her,

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:03.120
so we brought her along.

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:05.840
But unexpectedly, this morning,

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.680
her cat went missing from the backyard.

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.640
So she went after it

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.170
and has not returned since.

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.630
We've searched all of Pingjiang

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.480
and only found this.

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.100
Have you...

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:23.240
found the cat?

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:28.550
So far, we don't know whether the one

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:31.130
who abducted your daughter
was human or a demon.

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:32.520
That is precisely

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:34.210
why I came to the authorities.

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:35.350
We've learned that

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:37.720
several young women have gone missing
in Pingjiang these past few days.

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.580
Do you really have no leads at all?

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:43.010
Recently, the Feiyu Guard
wiped out the Demons' Valley.

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:46.110
We cannot rule out
the possibility that surviving demons

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:47.640
have returned for revenge.

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:48.240
My Lord,

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.880
we have placed talismans and seals

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.780
throughout Pingjiang.

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:55.110
If any minor demons are causing trouble,

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:58.890
they will not escape
the Qionghua Sect's swords.

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:05.360
We will handle this case

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:06.640
with full commitment

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.030
and give the Qionghua Sect
and the people of the city

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:11.290
a proper explanation.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:13.880
It had better be so.

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:16.830
Prefect.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.240
Please close the city gates

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:24.240
and post notices.

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:25.920
Until this case is solved,

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:27.580
women, children, and the weak

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.000
are not to go out alone.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.060
As you command.

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:36.500
Her scent is here!

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.350
Luoluo!

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:38.030
Luoluo!

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.110
This place is so far from Pingjiang.

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:41.650
Yueyue wouldn't come here.

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.750
-She's in the water!
-Luoluo.

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:45.310
-How could a person be in the water?
-Get up.

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:45.920
Luoluo!

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:48.110
-Did you smell it wrong?
-Get up. Get up!

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.750
Yueyue!

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:49.440
Get up!

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.290
Yueyue!

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:53.670
It's Yueyue!

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:54.950
Yueyue!

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:56.350
It's Yueyue!

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:57.920
I need to save her!

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:58.900
Luoluo!

00:29:58.930 --> 00:29:59.440
Get up!

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.510
Luoluo, get up!

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:01.270
Get up now!

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:03.880
I heard that in cases like this, it's
a water ghost looking for a replacement.

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.440
What should we do?

00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:06.520
I'll go down.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:07.790
No, no, Xiao Yao.

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:09.500
You just said there's a water ghost
in there.

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:11.160
It's fine. I'm a good swimmer.

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:12.300
No!

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:13.750
Here, take this.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.740
I'm afraid to hold it!

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:18.480
Watch it carefully.

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.360

Oh my goodness.

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.310
Is she awake?

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:42.510
Xiao Yao.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.730
Xiao Yao, you're awake?

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.160
It was Lord Bingzhu who just saved you.

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:56.370
Are you alright?

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:00.830
How is it you?

00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:02.440
Who else would it be?

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.240
I received Tan'er's signal.

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:07.570
Tan'er told me a great demon had appeared.

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:08.670
And I promised you

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.480
I would keep you safe.

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:13.530
Did you see...

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:16.630
Yes, I did.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.560
The lake is full of water ghosts,

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:21.449
souls of those who died unjustly.

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:23.770
Tan'er couldn't bear to slay them.

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:27.090
We've already sent boatmen
to retrieve the bodies.

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:28.739
Xiao Yao,

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.600
did you see Yueyue?

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:35.070
Not just her.

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:37.199
There were other girls too,

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.340
six in total.

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.550
It's alright. It's alright.

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:45.350
There, there.

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:46.880
Don't be sad. Don't be sad.

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:47.880
It's alright, Luoluo.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:48.920
You know

00:34:49.949 --> 00:34:50.750
those bodies?

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:53.270
Yueyue was my friend.

00:34:54.139 --> 00:34:57.450
She was just as kind as Xiao Yao and Dali.

00:34:57.590 --> 00:34:58.630
It's alright.

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:05.000
Then you should step aside for now.

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:07.320
I'm afraid once the bodies are brought up,

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.320
seeing them will be too much for you.

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:12.000
Go back now.

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:15.200
Yes, Xiao Yao.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.330
Hurry. You're soaking wet.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:18.510
Yueyue...

00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:19.070
Get up.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:20.360
Let's go.

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:28.190
I clearly saw Hong Ye.

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:29.920
How did it end up being him?

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:31.310
Wait a moment.

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:37.420
Lord Bingzhu.

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:38.560
Don't be afraid.

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:40.350
May I ask

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:42.000
how you saved me?

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:45.770
Didn't they already tell you?

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.490
I... What I want to ask is...

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:49.480
well...

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:51.880
did you...

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:53.640
give me...

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:55.280
mouth-to-mouth...

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:56.190
in the water?

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:57.480
Mouth-to-mouth?

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:58.440
Yes.

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.030
Absurd!

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:01.920
You... you...

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:03.030
You weren't out of air.

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:04.960
There was no need for such contact.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.510
That's good then.

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.360
I was just asking.

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:11.280
If you didn't, then you didn't.

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.300
Why are you getting angry?

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:13.300
Why so fierce?

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:16.710
Come back.

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.300
Tan'er still needs to be with you.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:37.630
Hong Ye,

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.620
was it really you who saved me?

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:56.210
Does this pendant stop working
once it touches water?

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.260
One more time.

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:21.190
Isn't this a scam?

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:24.360
In my travels,

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:26.550
I only trick people
out of small change and food at most.

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:29.280
But you actually trick people
out of their lives.

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:30.320
I...

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:33.000
Come on.

00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:47.130
Do you think you're still human?

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.800
You're a demon yourself.

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:52.500
Why do you still persecute the demons
so relentlessly?

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:12.190
Tan'er,

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.250
please don't move without reason.

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:27.480
[Pingjiang Prefecture Office]

00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:29.630
My Lord,

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.080
they're all the same.

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:02.360
Their blood has been completely drained.

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:04.030
If it's only the blood that was drained,

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:06.030
why have their pupils turned black,

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:10.510
and why is their skin still elastic?

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:34.550
This is...

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:36.270
Soul-binding Spell.

00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:40.110
My Lord.

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:44.430
My Lord, the victims' families
are here to identify the bodies.

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:56.230
Yue...

00:39:57.590 --> 00:39:58.790
Keep your voice down.

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:02.700
Down there are all Feiyu Guards.

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:04.360
We can only

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.020
take one last look at her here.

00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:08.840
Yueyue was the only one

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:11.320
who ever treated me
that well besides my mom.

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:17.800
My child!

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:21.230
My daughter! My daughter!

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:24.560
I can't even cry for her openly

00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:27.190
like the people inside.

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:28.400
Alright, Luoluo.

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.240
We'll be good to you too.

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.480
My daughter died unjustly!

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:34.550
My Lord, please find the culprit

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:36.300
and avenge my daughter!

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.440
My condolences, everyone.

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:39.090
We will capture the culprit
as soon as possible

00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:40.350
and bring you justice.

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:42.400
My Lord.

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.550
I'm begging you.

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:48.510
Master,

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:49.820
Junior is not here.

00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:51.110
Are...

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:52.760
Are you sure?

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:54.030
Yes.

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:14.320
Feiyu Guard,

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.150
are you absolutely certain

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:18.280
no other bodies were found in the lake?

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:20.030
We've searched the whole lake.

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:21.960
There were indeed no other bodies.

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:23.180
Well...

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:25.880
So we still have a glimmer of hope, right?

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:27.880
These bodies cannot remain overnight.

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:29.440
They'll transform if exposed to moonlight.

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:31.500
Arrange for cremation immediately.

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:33.630
Take the bodies away.

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:34.890
Family members,

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:36.150
please follow me.

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:41.200
My Lord,

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:43.000
Just now, I noticed that

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:43.490
although the bodies
were submerged in the lake,

00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:45.030
[Justice of the World]

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:46.840
there was no sign of decay,

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:49.770
and their skin was still elastic.

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:50.650
It's...

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:51.880
These girls

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:53.840
all died after the blood in their bodies

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:55.240
was completely drained.

00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:58.440
How incredibly cruel.

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:01.510
The murderer not only drained their blood

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:03.280
but also cast the Soul-binding Spell

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:05.340
before throwing them into the water.

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:06.730
That is why their bodies

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.280
neither rotted nor sank,

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:09.670
were neither dead nor alive,

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:11.230
are unable to enter reincarnation,

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:13.280
and are difficult for the living to find.

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:16.150
They are suspended forever
between the three realms.

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:17.400
The Soul-binding Spell

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:18.600
is extremely complex

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:21.050
and very hard to perform.

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:23.430
It has not appeared for over 100 years.

00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:24.150
My Lord,

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:26.510
are you certain of this?

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.840
It is recorded in the secret archives
of the Feiyu Guard.

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:31.150
Because this spell is so vicious,

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:32.880
it left a deep impression on me.

00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:35.760
If not for the overwhelming resentment
of these women,

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.110
who died unjustly,
breaking through the spell

00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:38.570
and drawing people there,

00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:40.480
we might never have found them.

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:42.800
Such cruel methods,

00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:46.110
and the ability to use
a forbidden technique from a century ago—

00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:47.960
other than the Demon King Hong Ye,

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:49.440
I can't think of anyone else.

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:51.480
Since our daughter has not yet been found,

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:52.740
there should still be

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:54.610
a sliver of hope.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:57.750
My Lord,

00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:02.870
we earnestly ask the Feiyu Guard to
capture the culprit as soon as possible.

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:03.760
Please.

00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:04.980
Of course.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:13.800
Sir.

00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:19.110
Sir,

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:22.190
what should we do now?

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:23.280
Mr. Liu,

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:25.920
Pingjiang Prefecture
is under your jurisdiction.

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:27.760
With such a major case having occurred,

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:29.160
as the local magistrate,

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:31.500
shouldn't you do something about it?

00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:32.630
Do something?

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:34.190
Catching demons

00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:36.480
is simply beyond my abilities.

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:37.110
Mr. Liu,

00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:40.550
would you be willing
to use your two daughters as bait

00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:41.510
to lure out the Demon King

00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:42.670
and rid the people of this menace?

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:43.600
Absolutely not!

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:44.150
I...

00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:45.400
With the Feiyu Guard here,

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:46.550
you have nothing to fear.

00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:48.150
We will ensure their safety.

00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:50.360
This great demon
has grown far too rampant.

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:51.860
If we don't find a way to slay it...

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:52.660
Xiao Yao,

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:53.360
let's go.

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:54.480
That's still not acceptable.

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:56.110
I only have these two precious daughters.

00:43:56.110 --> 00:43:58.280
I cannot watch them
be sent to their deaths.

00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:01.070
And how do you know the next victim
won't be your family?

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:02.830
It absolutely won't happen to my family.
