What's hidden behind you?

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.640
I don't think

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.350
you're a heartless man.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.960
You granted me a place

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.240
and healed the common demons.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.680
I wished to send flowers as thanks,

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.000
but I never knew your flowers
were so rare.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.840
Immortals are all

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.590
hypocrites.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.350
Keep the flowers

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.590
for yourself.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.400
If you come here again,

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.870
I will not let it slide.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.000
Sorry, demon.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.950
I'm your enemy, after all.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.840
Your disciple has betrayed us

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.950
and is close to Jie Chuan.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.510
All demons know that.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.840
You were punished by lightning
because of that.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.270
(Feng Tian, Immortal Sovereign)
Why do you

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.040
still plead for her?

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.270
Your Grace,

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.470
my disciple may be unruly,

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.740
but she'd never betray us.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:11.820
(Huan Zhen, Peach Fairy)

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.780
This must be Jie Chuan's scheme
to sow discord.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.400
This is the Demon Defense Array.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.560
To prove her innocence,

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.910
Ji Li snuck in to steal it.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.470
Please make a fair judgment.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.670
(Ying Ge, Cloud Fairy)
Though Ji Li is

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.300
in the Demon Realm,
she's still with us.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.590
With the Array,

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.280
the Demon Realm is within reach.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.280
Your Grace,

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.460
she broke Jie Chuan's seal.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.640
The evidence is undeniable.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.190
(Shang Yang, Immortal)
Maybe Jie Chuan

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.850
and she are using the Array

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.850
as bait to trap us.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.910
I spoke up for my disciple,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.400
for I know her nature is pure and kind.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.470
As her master,

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.220
I am willing to go to the Demon Realm

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.680
and test if the Array is genuine.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.520
I'll risk my life

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.310
to bring Ji Li back

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.400
and face whatever judgment.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.150
It's been five days
since the Array was sent.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.000
Master hasn't replied even once.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.280
Master used to say

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.630
demons are bloodthirsty by nature

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.960
and unforgivable.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.500
Thus, we must destroy them
to ensure peace.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.360
But since I arrived here...

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.910
You immortals, no matter your rank,

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.150
have the dew and light
to cultivate with.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.870
But demons have only

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.750
this single patch of sunlight.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.150
You once asked

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.120
why we lack your flowers

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.430
to draw in the miasma.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.310
Now, do you have your answer?

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.680
Can't both the clans

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.710
live together in peace?

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.960
Ji Li.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.080
Master.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.680
I have arrived.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:28.800
Withdraw now.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.480
I can't get the Demon Fruit
in the Immortal Realm.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.800
And I'll take

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.930
all these magical tools back.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.070
Ying Ge will surely like

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.190
this Night Lamp.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.250
I'll take them all back.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.120
Where are you going?

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.190
Master, help me!

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.360
If you don't come,
I'll be sliced like raw fish!

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.720
Master!

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.070
Killing her

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.390
is not that easy.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.190
(Hong Zhua,)

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.190
(you've finally taken the bait.)

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.720
Master, be careful.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:09.470
Master!

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.910
Master!

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.120
So,

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.190
you gave me the Array on purpose.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.000
You deceived me.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.560
Jie Chuan,

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:39.920
if you kill her,

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:41.310
you won't be able

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.160
to save her again,

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.710
even if you drain all your cultivation.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.470
Let my master go!

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:48.800
You cunning trickster.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.600
Do you really think

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.920
that a mere immortal

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.430
could possibly bind me?

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:11.760
You truly

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.160
underestimate me far too much.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:27.240
If you stay silent,

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.920
I'll kill her right now.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.600
It was you who forgot.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.040
300 years ago,

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.240
you offered your Memory Power

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.360
to protect her soul.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:45.630
From that day on,

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:48.830
your souls became bound as one.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.000
You cannot harm her.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.180
Why?

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:57.600
If you kill her,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.600
your Demonic Ether

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.270
will be drained to nothing.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.200
Jie Chuan,

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.920
you know what's been happening

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.870
between you and Ji Li lately.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.740
If you don't believe me,

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.510
try it, and you'll see.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.150
(As expected, our souls are connected.)

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:50.230
Jie Chuan?

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:54.000
How do we break this?

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.840
If you don't speak, I'll kill you.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:01.960
You can't harm my master.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.120
If you dare touch him,

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.750
I'll fight you with everything I have,

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:06.230
even if it means death.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:18.390
Master, water.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.840
Master, it's so dark.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:47.110
Your Grace.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.080
Bring them a candle stand.

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:53.750
Your Grace.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.080
I think

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.600
we should kill them

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:59.030
to avoid distraction.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.240
Do I need

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.960
to repeat myself?

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:06.110
Yes.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:10.790
(It was you who forgot.)

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.750
(300 years ago,)

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:14.840
(you offered your Memory Power)

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.720
(to protect her soul.)

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.200
(To Jie Chuan)

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.600
(Presented by Jin Li)

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.150
(I've returned to the Immortal Realm.)

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.700
(Flowers imbued with Taiqing Power)

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.100
(can last for three months.)

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.630
(It may be useful.)

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:39.750
(Thanks for sparing my life.)

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.380
(To Jie Chuan; Presented by Jin Li)

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.550
(Since I chose)

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.440
(to forget the past,)

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:15.960
(there's no need to recall it.)

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:34.800
Hurry up.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:36.870
Your Grace.

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:37.710
She's here.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.240
Ji Li,

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:47.550
don't think I wouldn't dare kill you.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.200
As I said,

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.700
I've only lived for 300 years.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.680
I know nothing
of what happened 300 years ago.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.150
If you insist on blaming me for this,

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:55.990
fine.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:57.790
I'll face the consequences.

00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:59.480
If you kill me,
you must spare my master.

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:01.790
Master?

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.070
Why hold you to account

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.790
for the past?

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.440
You keep calling me a liar.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.150
Yet you stole the Array.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.390
Isn't that also a kind of lie?

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.080
That's only to protect myself.

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.240
Even a cornered rabbit will bite back.

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:23.080
Do lies come

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.790
in different shades and ranks?

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:28.240
The Array decides our fate.

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:30.540
You want it to protect yourself?

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:32.440
That's far-fetched.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.150
You're so shameless.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.270
You're gambling
with the Demon Realm.

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:38.480
I haven't blamed you yet.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:41.240
I even left flowers
and notes to warn you.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.390
My kindness was all wasted.

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:44.390
- You...
- Stop talking.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:46.030
You just think I'm an easy target.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:47.440
I'm not backing down today.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.030
Just kill me here and now.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.120
Come on, do it then.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.060
I'll be a proud spirit

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.130
in 200 years.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.200
I don't even care to kill you.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.120
But there's no place

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.270
for idlers here.

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:03.510
You won't kill me?

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:04.850
If you can prove your worth,

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.030
I'll consider sparing your life.

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:10.790
I'm very useful.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.480
I left this plant to clear the miasma.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:15.120
I can't manage most other tasks,

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.440
but I'm good at planting.

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:19.840
However, I'm just a fish.

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:21.270
My skill lies in water.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.440
You don't have many water tanks.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.360
And I'm so weak.

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:28.790
I'll have to talk
to my master about this.

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.000
You're pushing your luck.

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:32.610
Do you want to do this?

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:33.480
Yes, yes.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.320
I'll do it.

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:35.670
No need to get angry.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:18.800
Who's there?

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.080
What are you doing?

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:24.790
As a demon,

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.200
how dare you steal from me?

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:28.390
Put it down,

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.030
then I'll spare your life.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.320
No.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.720
You can use the spirit plant

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.480
to heal the demonic barrier;

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:35.840
why should we outside

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.360
have to wait every day for charity?

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:40.030
Even if you kill me, I won't accept it.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.650
The Sovereign is truly cruel.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.080
He's not being fair.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.550
Do you know

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:45.720
who I am?

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.840
I don't care who you are.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.150
Even if you're the Sovereign,

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:49.200
I will still speak up.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.670
With so many flowers here,
why can't we take them?

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:53.000
We are all demons.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.720
Are our lives worth any less?

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.670
Still, you can't steal.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:03.550
What's the point of stealing
a withered one?

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:22.150
Your Sovereign

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.840
is a terrible man.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.960
He forced me alone
to cultivate spirit plants

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.270
and numbered the plants

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:32.200
for the distribution later.

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:43.270
These are meant for us?

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:44.510
Of course.

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:45.510
Look here.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.320
Here's something worse.

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.550
He forced me to cultivate spirit plants,

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:54.960
but he'd destroy every plant

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.080
I managed to grow
with a demonic barrier.

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:59.030
So, it took me three to five tries

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:01.270
to get a resilient spiritual plant.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.120
The one you're holding now

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.840
hasn't been destroyed yet.

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.320
And that's not all.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.770
Do you know what's most infuriating?

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.480
He was worried you young ones
wouldn't get your share.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.080
He ordered the soldiers

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.080
to go door-to-door
and register all the demons.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.630
I'm so pitiable.

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:19.240
I must plant

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.720
and tend to the wounded.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.030
Your Sovereign

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.080
is nothing

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.510
but a cunning manipulator

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:27.030
full of tricks.

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:28.870
You can't insult the Sovereign.

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:31.000
He only thinks of the clan.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.280
Immortals like you won't get it.

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:33.750
Now, I understand.

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:34.590
You can't insult him.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:35.910
Take this back.

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:36.750
You just stay here

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:38.120
and cultivate spirit plants.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:39.840
You...

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:46.630
Credit me for this,

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:47.470
Your Grace.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:49.840
Once I've gathered enough merit,

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.320
please let Master and me leave.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:53.750
Master?

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:55.390
I'm feeling a bit hungry.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.200
Could you get some food
for Master and me?

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.630
Demon Fruit would be perfect.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.630
I've got a headache.

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:05.510
Perhaps I've exhausted

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:07.070
my spiritual power.

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:12.110
Today,

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.200
I'm also exhausted.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:14.660
Pause the cultivation.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:15.640
Tomorrow,

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.000
you can't use any spiritual power.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.750
As for food,

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.720
you'll be well provided for.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:31.160
Can't you just say I can rest?

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:36.670
Ms. Luo,

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:39.200
didn't the Sovereign decide
to kill Ji Li?

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:40.750
Why the sudden change?

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:43.510
Ji Li is nothing but trouble.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:46.890
It doesn't matter what she is.

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:49.240
If she stands in the way
of the Sovereign's plans,

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:50.510
she cannot be spared.

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:54.830
I'll drive the Phantom Nail

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:56.350
into Hong Zhua's body.

00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:58.550
He will see anyone

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:00.070
wearing the Phantom Ring

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:02.240
as the one he despises most.

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:05.400
Go put it on Ji Li.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.440
Tell her it's for the Sovereign
to watch her.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.040
Yes.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.480
Ji Li,

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:16.160
since demons couldn't kill you,

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.550
immortals can rid us

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.200
of you.

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:24.190
Ji Li.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.830
The Sovereign wants you
to wear this ring.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:28.950
Hurry.

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.920
Hurry up.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.380
Time for the performance

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:50.400
of Hong Zhua.

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:59.040
