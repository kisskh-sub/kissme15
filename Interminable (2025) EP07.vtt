Khun Yai is Chao Meun Samur Jairatch…

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.120
Kaewta!

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.040
What should I do to
be free from it, Luangta?

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.280
Atone for one's sins.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.880
No, I don't want that.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.160
Go back before it's too late.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.720
Stop!

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.160
You remember me now, don't you?

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.360
No, not yet.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.056
Give it to Kaew, in
case he wants to find out.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.440
But he'll have only one hour.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.960
Isn't that Lady Chuichai, sir?

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.400
Kaewta.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.000
Where are those two?

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.760
Khun Phra Nai.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.760
Kaewta.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.400
They both look pretty, Miss.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.440
Let's ask my brother.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.960
Brother…

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.400
Oh…Brother?

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.600
Som, where's he?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.536
Khun Phra Nai!

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.136
Khun Phra Nai!

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.160
Som!

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.056
I was helping you choosing the accessories.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.280
How would I know, Miss?

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.600
Go find him then.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.880
Yes, Miss.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.920
Good evening.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.600
Are you waiting for anyone?

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.800
It's Kan and Ruedee. We'll
float our krathong together.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.720
- I see.
- Oh, Khun Kaewta!

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.840
What a coincidence.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.200
I'm here to see my friends.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.800
How nice. You already have
someone to float a krathong with.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.280
But poor Khun Yai though. He
still couldn't find anyone to do it with.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.040
What are you babbling about?

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.920
Isn't it true, sir?

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.296
I'm afraid you'll have to do it alone…

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.480
Since I have to go pay
respect to the abbot.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.200
I've already made an appointment.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.680
Khun Kaew, can you please take
him with you to float the krathong?

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.880
Saen!

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.640
I thought you said you wanted to do it.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.000
Please enjoy floating, sir.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.680
I'm going.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.760
Saen!

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.280
Saen…

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.880
You don't have to do it if you don't want
to. Please go and have fun with your friends.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.280
I can do it alone.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.040
Please wait.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.320
This was please.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.800
Oh, you're done shopping, Miss?

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.800
Saen, where's my brother?

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.640
Khun Phra Nai has an
appointment with the abbot.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.880
He said he has some
matters to discuss with him.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.480
Is that so?

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:32.920
Yes, Miss.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.280
But if you wish to float the krathong,

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.416
Khun Phra Nai already
has it prepared for you, Miss.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.000
This one is for you, Lady Sophee.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.560
And this one is for Khun Phra Nai.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.240
Let's have a seat and
wait here for a while, Miss.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Please.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.280
- Give me two cups of tea.
- Yes, sir.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.600
So pretty, Miss.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.640
Pay respect to the abbot? I bet
it's just an excuse to see the girl.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.840
I must apologize for him
for causing you such trouble.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.560
Not at all, sir.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.960
I also told my friends to meet up here.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.320
But I'm afraid I must
have just missed them.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.520
Is this krathong pretty?

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.480
Yes, it is.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.640
Where on earth are Kan and Ruedee?

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.720
What about this one, is it pretty?

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.080
Yes, it is.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.640
Which one is prettier?

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.920
This one.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.640
Then, this one is for you.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.760
Thank you.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.480
Let's float them together.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.120
Isn't that…

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.920
Chao Meun Samur Jairatch.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.800
So handsome.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.200
Yes. Let's go.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.840
I haven't done this for a while.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.000
Thank you for doing it with me.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.800
If our krathongs keep
floating side by side like this,

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:48.320
they say it means we'd
be long-lasting lovers.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.120
Have you ever heard of it?

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.040
Never heard of it, sir.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.400
It's not unusual for our krathongs
to be drifting side by side…

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.640
Since we've released
them from the same spot.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.400
I like it when you refer to us as 'we'.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.600
What are you looking at?

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.320
Can't I look?

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.920
What's so interesting to look at?

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.920
I'm also a man like you, Khun Yai.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.200
Not a lady with a face so pretty to look at.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:51.640
You're right.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:57.600
You and I are both men.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.120
That's right, there's a stall
selling candied jujube over there.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.040
Do you want to eat it?

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.240
Are you thirsty, Som?

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.840
Geez, you brat.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.240
Why is he taking so long?

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.520
Would you like more tea, Miss?

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.800
Give me one more.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.840
One more.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.000
Yes, sir.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:56.240
Chao Meun Samur Jairatch
is so handsome, isn't he?

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.280
The one next to him is also good looking.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:05.560
Wait.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.880
Are you girls talking about
Chao Meun Samur Jairatch?

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.760
Yes, he surely looks
so fine as rumour has it.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.240
Where is Chao Meun Samur Jairatch?

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.800
Over there, Miss.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.080
Som, let's go!

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.160
Yes, Miss.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.640
Wait for me too.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.240
- I'll pay you later.
- Yes.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:41.960
Just a second.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.440
Let me.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.760
Here. Please try it, Khun Yai.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:16.040
Hmm, so good.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.720
Have you never tried it before?

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.280
No.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.320
What's so funny?

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.680
It's funny you've never
had candied jujube before.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.000
I've never met anyone who hasn't.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.240
Kaew!

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:45.936
Oh, Ruedee.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:46.960
Kan.

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.480
Good evening, Khun Phra Nai.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.640
I've been looking for you everywhere.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:01.120
How come you're with Khun Phra Nai?

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Well…

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.840
We met by chance.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:11.280
I never thought someone like you'd be
interested to hang around in this kind of place.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.960
Why? Why can't someone
like me come to this place?

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:21.800
Well, it's just a small festival at
the temple. I'm surprised, that's all.

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:28.176
Don't be. If other
people can do it, so can I.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.800
I'm also human.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.720
Kaew, there's a show performing over there.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.440
Shall we go see it?

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:54.656
Really?

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.000
- Yes.
- Let's go then.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.760
Please excuse me and my friends then.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.440
Goodbye, Khun Phra Nai.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.600
Goodbye.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.360
Let's go.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.120
Let's go, Kan. Come, Kaew.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.720
Brother!

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.200
Sophee.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.040
What are you doing here?

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.720
Well…I…

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.880
Have you found the candied jujube, sir?

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.000
You've been craving for it since yesterday.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:37.800
That's right.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:41.800
But earlier, I saw you
talking with someone here.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:47.520
Oh, that's the dancer from Uncle's place.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:53.720
I accidentally ran into her, so I asked
her to tell Uncle I'll go see him tomorrow.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.160
It's nothing important.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:56.960
Is that so?

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.000
Enough with the coughing.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:13.280
Geez, my soul almost left the body.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.640
Fortunately, Lady Sophee
didn't question you any further.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.080
Are you listening to what I'm saying, sir?

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:29.960
Why should I?

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.520
Things went well after all.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:38.880
I also don't see why I must hide
when I'm spending time with Kaewta.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.120
Now, you can say it.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:48.760
Does this mean you will no longer refrain
your feelings for Lady Chuichai, Khun Yai?

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.520
Damn you.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.360
Why would you think of him?

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.800
Don't you ever think about it, Kaew.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.440
What's so interesting to look at?

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.440
I'm also a man like you, Khun Yai.

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.560
Not a lady with a face so pretty to look at.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.280
Any update?

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.760
Not yet, sir. I'll try to find
out as soon as possible.

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.680
You'd better hurry up. If they start to
make a move, we could be in trouble.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.480
Yes, sir.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.920
Khun Phra Nai has
already left for work, Miss.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.400
Have you prepared it as I said, Som?

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.120
Everything, Miss.

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.680
Isn't that a servant from Chao
Phraya Narubodin's place?

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.920
What the heck are they all doing here?

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.400
Lately, I've heard quite nasty rumours.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.000
About those who are over ambitious, sir?

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.200
Yes, you also know about it?

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.120
I heard they are mostly young soldiers…

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.280
Who are not quite satisfied,
and want to make a change.

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:18.256
Those rascals! No matter how
good their commander treats them,

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:22.736
these ungrateful brats
will always find excuses…

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:27.520
And justifications for
themselves to seize power.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.720
Please don't worry, Uncle.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:33.080
The Royal Guard
Regiment is also not at ease.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:36.120
We're trying to find a way to spy on them…

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.360
To get evidence and have them arrested.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:43.400
Good. Traitors should
be destroyed at any cost.

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.360
Yes, sir.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:49.400
I shall never trouble His Majesty with
such a dispute even for the slightest bit.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:53.800
I'm quite relieved to hear that.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.960
My only concern is His Majesty.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.600
Your snacks, Uncle.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.640
If there's nothing else, I'd like to
go home to look after my mother.

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.360
Go on.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.360
Goodbye, sir.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.800
Khun Yai!

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.760
Are you perhaps interested in Kaew?

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.480
I wasn't looking at Kaew, sir.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:40.880
I was looking at…at Saen.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:42.800
Really?

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:49.240
Earlier, I saw how your eyes kept tracing on
him, so much you almost twisted your neck.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:57.400
It's not like that at all. I think you're
misunderstanding something, Uncle.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:04.776
Son, you might be able to fool anyone,

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.320
but you can't fool your own heart.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.240
I

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.920
I might not have a wife,

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:20.080
but that doesn't mean I won't
understand anything about love.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.600
Love? You call it love, Uncle?

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:30.200
Why? Or do you only call it 'love'
when it's between man and woman?

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.720
What a waste graduating from abroad.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.760
I thought you'd be more open-minded.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:44.880
Listen, son.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:51.320
Love…as long as it's not unfaithful…

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:55.480
Or doesn't hurt anyone,

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.200
is never right or wrong.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:04.696
People make all the rules and conditions,
that love should be like this or like that.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.280
All just to satisfy themselves.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.240
Uncle.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:16.760
Whether between men or women, if they have
feelings for each other—isn't that also love?

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.600
You are certainly right, Uncle.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.360
It's us who set up all those rules.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.880
Thank you very much,

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.560
for your kind words of advice.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:38.800
I'd be taking my leave then.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.320
Where are you going, Khun Yai?

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.640
To find my love, Saen.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:03.160
Khun Yai.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:08.360
Don't you think it's a little too much
rushing to see him at his place like this?

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.056
Too much or not, I couldn't care less.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.976
But at this moment,

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.360
not seeing Kaewta for just
one day feels like months to me.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:21.480
Wouldn't a few days feel like a year then?

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.880
You've fallen head over
heels for him, Khun Yai.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.640
Should I worry about it?

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:35.840
Of course, we still don't know
how Khun Kaewta feels about you.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:39.680
That's why I have to talk to him now.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:48.320
This is exactly why they said a burning
desire can never truly be extinguished.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:53.760
Like a bird flying against the storm.
Not even the strongest wind can stop it.

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:57.920
Who said that?

00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.680
I've never heard of it.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.720
It's me, sir.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.320
It was my saying.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:15.920
Anyway, I need you to take care
of something important for me first.

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:22.600
Don't worry, I'll make
sure it's taken care of.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.960
Where have they gone?

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:25.777
Saen!

00:26:25.801 --> 00:26:26.960
Yes, it's me.

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.080
Please let me go.

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.376
Go and tell your Lady Sophee…

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:34.816
That if she wants to know Khun Phra Nai's
whereabouts, no need to send someone to spy on us.

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.720
Just ask him directly.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.080
Do you get it?

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:38.920
Do you?!

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.200
Yes!

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.240
Go!

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.840
He's already taken care of, sir.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.400
Good.

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:20.400
Will he know it was just an excuse?

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.720
Will he think I'm trying to avoid him?

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:39.120
Geez, are you crazy?

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.120
Why would you keep thinking about him?

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.400
Kaew.

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.440
You even came all the way here, Khun Yai?

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:55.960
Yes.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.840
I've been looking for you everywhere.

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.176
Why would you look for me?

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:19.600
You already heard me telling Uncle that I
had to come home to look after my mother.

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.880
Wasn't that because you wanted to avoid me?

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:29.640
Avoid you? I think you've got it wrong.

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:33.440
Then, why did you suddenly leave
when you saw me visiting there?

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:39.960
As far as I know, weren't you there to
discuss business matters with Uncle?

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:41.880
That's correct.

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:46.640
But don't you know I could also
use that as an excuse to see you?

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.600
No, sir.

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.640
And I also don't want to know it.

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.120
Are you mad at me?

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:07.360
Khun Yai, this is my house.

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:11.440
Please move over. It's inappropriate.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:21.680
Mat at you?

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:29.600
Do you think you know me well
enough to say that kind of thing?

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.880
It's because I still don't,

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.400
that's why I'd like you
to give me a chance.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.640
Will you please allow me to
get to know you more, Kaewta?

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.240
What for?

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.200
So that I…

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:49.920
- Miss Payom!
- Mum!

00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:00.320
What? You got exposed by Khun Yai and Saen?

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.296
All I've asked is for you to keep track
of his whereabouts. But you still failed.

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.200
Perhaps this is not what you're good at.

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.200
I'm so sorry, Miss.

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:13.200
So, what did you say when you got caught?

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:18.120
Khun Phra Nai didn't speak to me directly.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:26.000
But he told Saen to relay his message to you,
that if you ever want to know anything about him,

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:28.160
you can just ask him directly,

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.840
and that you should
never do this again, Miss.

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:36.200
Saen, that brat! You're also useless!

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:41.520
Miss, you should punish
him so that he won't fail again.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.640
You can't even get an easy job done.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:47.200
How could we trust you to
handle anything next time?

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.200
You can go now.

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.160
Yes, sir. Thank you, Miss.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.960
But Miss,

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.920
Are you really not going to punish him?

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.240
What good would I get from
punishing someone like that?

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:07.480
That's odd. Why is she so kind today?

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.736
But you were right, Som.

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:13.760
If he can't even get such an easy job done, how
could I trust him to do anything in the future?

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:20.576
That's why the one who
should be punished…is you.

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.440
Pong! Do it.

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.240
Yes, Miss.

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.120
I've been waiting for this day, Bitch!

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:40.800
Careful, Mum.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.800
Yes, yes. Thank you, dear.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.960
Thank you so much for helping me, Yai.

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:57.760
Really, I'm fine, dear.

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:02.800
No, you're not. You just fainted.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.440
I'll be fine soon.

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:13.240
You too, Yai. Why did you
tell Saen to go get the doctor?

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:15.120
Don't worry about it.

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:21.760
There they are.

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:23.720
We're here, sir.

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:31.560
This way, please.

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:35.600
Hello.

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:38.520
Hello.

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:50.480
How's she doing?

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.560
I think we'll get her some medicine,
and she should be fine again in a few days.

00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:00.256
So, I'll order her some medicine.

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:01.280
Okay, sure.

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:04.840
Saen, go with the doctor to
drop him off and get the medicine.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:05.960
Yes, sir.

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.320
This way, please.

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:09.280
Goodbye.

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:10.320
Goodbye.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:11.520
Thank you, Doctor.

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:13.360
This way, please.

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:26.640
Thank you so much for your help, Yai.

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:33.536
By the way, what do you do for a living?

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:35.680
How did you and Kaew know each other?

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:47.800
Mum, Khun Yai is Khun Phra
Nai or Chao Meun Samur Jairatch.

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:51.920
Chao Meun Samur Jairatch…the royal guard?

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:55.640
Please don't do that.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.120
I often have business matters
to discuss with Luang Sanor.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.136
That's how I've come to know Kaewta.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.840
I see.

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:20.239
Thank you for your kind help, Khun Yai.

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:24.440
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:29.159
I don't want it. I helped
you because I wanted to.

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:40.960
You don't have to do that.

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.199
Thank you, Khun Yai.

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:53.440
I'll come to check on your mother
every day until she gets better.

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:56.639
Please don't. It's inappropriate.

00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:58.360
How inappropriate?

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:04.440
A nobleman like you coming to
visit a house of a lowly dancer,

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:07.520
other people might be
talking badly about it.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.280
Noble or lowly, appropriate
or not-it's up to me to decide.

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.360
I don't care what other people would say.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:18.697
But

00:35:18.721 --> 00:35:20.520
I'm honestly worried about your mother.

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:25.480
Please let me make
sure she's fully recovered.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.320
Fine.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:35.560
I'd better get going then. Go
on in to look after your mother.

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.400
Let's go.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.440
Yes, sir.

00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.320
How dare you!

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.177
Give me that!

00:36:00.201 --> 00:36:03.000
No! You give me that! How dare you!

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.480
Why wouldn't I?

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.360
- Give it to me now!
- Stop!

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.120
That's enough!

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:09.920
Stop right now, both of you! Stop!

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.000
You should stop, my dear sister.

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:23.600
If you keep punishing them like this,
I'm afraid they might be crippled soon.

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:32.400
I don't see any difference if these
useless maggots were to turn a cripple.

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:40.480
True that. But where else will you find a servant
like Som who knows exactly what you're thinking?

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.080
You're absolutely right, Master Prom.

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:49.096
'Don't put the wrong man on the
wrong job.'... Do you remember, Som?

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:50.800
You taught me that yourself.

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:57.976
Yes, Miss. I'll be more
careful next time, I promise.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000
Waste of time.

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.640
Thank you so much, Master Prom.

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:08.640
What the heck are you looking at?

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:20.720
Miss, Khun Phra Nai is back.

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.120
What is it, Prom?

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:57.520
Who are they? Why are they
plotting against the royal court?

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:03.200
Based on my information so far,
they are probably the Young Turks.

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.000
This group of citizens
is eager for a change.

00:38:06.001 --> 00:38:16.655
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.240
A change?

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.880
These new-generation
people are still inexperienced.

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:17.240
They often believe that
change is always a good thing.

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:25.080
But a change made foolishly is like
setting up a fire to your own house.

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.760
You are absolutely right, Father.

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:32.000
A big tree can stand tall
because of its deep roots.

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.160
Not because it keeps swaying
every time the wind blows.

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.560
The world could change…

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:46.400
But morals and goodness
should always remain in your heart.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.200
Remember that.

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:51.800
Yes, Father.

00:38:55.640 --> 00:39:00.000
Don't let anyone know
what we talked about today.

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:03.640
Whatever you do,
always keep it confidential.

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:07.080
It's for your own safety too, son.

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:09.400
Yes, Father.

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.400
Please excuse me then.

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:25.760
Father doesn't need to see a son of
his own blood and flesh every single day.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.240
What is it, Prom?

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:31.200
Nothing.

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:35.440
Brother.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.480
- Let's go, Boon.
- Yes, sir.

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:47.240
Please don't mind him.

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:53.160
I'm a big brother. I can always
forgive my younger siblings…

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.520
As long as they feel sorry about it.

00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:00.000
I'm truly sorry.

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:04.400
I saw how badly injured you were
the other day and I was worried.

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:07.600
So, I just sent someone
to guard on you, that's all.

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.720
Please don't do it again.

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:15.120
This brother of yours is Chao Meun
Samur Jairatch, the king's royal guard.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.600
No one would dare to hurt me.

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:19.840
You don't have to worry.

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:23.080
Yes.

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:49.360
It's because I still don't
know you well enough,

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.000
that's why I'd like you
to give me a chance.

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:56.160
Will you please allow me to
get to know you more, Kaewta?

00:40:58.440 --> 00:40:59.520
Why?

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:03.120
So that I…

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:06.040
- Miss Payom!
- Mum!

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:18.280
Why is it? I really want to know.

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:21.160
It's too late to ask him now.

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:31.920
But wait, why would I want to know it?

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.480
Kaew, why are you still up?

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:48.680
I'm better now. You don't need
to stay up late to watch over me.

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:51.360
I just can't sleep, Mum.

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:57.680
That's right, I have something to ask you.

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:06.880
Why did Khun Phra Nai come here
to ask for you not just once but twice?

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:12.480
He came to our house before?

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:18.856
Yes, he came to ask for a Chuichai dancer.

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:24.560
The one who performed at
the prince's palace that day.

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:26.240
Is that so?

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.040
I have no idea too, Mum.

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:39.120
Kaew, I know I've raised you to grow
up as a man with his own thoughts.

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.280
But I'm still worried somehow.

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.200
About what, Mum?

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:50.240
About Khun Phra Nai.

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:58.320
He's a nobleman with a high ranking.

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:02.040
Even though he seems to
be very kind and fond of you,

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:08.200
I don't want you to get
too familiar with him.

00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:16.160
Although Luang Sanor has agreed
to take you in as his adopted son,

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:20.440
you should never forget your own root.

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:24.000
After all, we're only servants, dear.

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:33.880
I've never had that kind
of thought in mind, Mum.

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:37.920
I believe you.

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:47.040
But I still want you to be careful.
Don't let your feelings grow too far.

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:49.840
Or else you might regret it later.

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:57.320
Yes, Mum.

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:18.200
Som is here, sir.

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:24.920
Why would you like to see me, Master?

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:27.056
I want you to do something for me.

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:29.520
Think of it as a favour
returned for helping you earlier.

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:32.696
You only have to say it, Master Prom.

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:35.000
I'll do anything for you.

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:40.840
Keep an eye on that brat,
I mean Khun Yai, for me.

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:46.096
Khun Yai?

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:47.120
Yes.

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:50.880
Everything about him, report it to me.

00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:52.720
Can you do that?

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.360
Yes, Master.

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:00.760
Good. Let's go, Boon.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.040
Please wait.

00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:06.880
What is it?

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:10.120
I'm not sure if you'd want to know this.

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:16.080
But lately, Khun Yai often
goes to visit Luang Sanor's place.

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.880
Luang Sanor from the Bureau
of Thai Classical Dance?

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.120
Yes, Master.

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:42.560
Khun Yai!

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:51.880
Why are you here?

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:53.577
I brought some…

00:45:53.601 --> 00:45:54.840
Shh!

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.240
I brought some nourishing
food for your mother.

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:09.440
Please take it back.

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:15.360
And don't come here again.

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:17.760
Wait.

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:19.640
Is there something wrong?

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:22.520
You were smiling at
me when I left yesterday.

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:25.400
Yesterday is gone.

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.200
Today is what matters.

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:30.160
Please go back, Khun Yai.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.840
Have I done anything to
upset you? Please tell me.

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:41.680
No, it has nothing to do with you.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.960
I'm rather mad at myself.

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:48.280
What do you mean?

00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:52.240
You don't need to know it.

00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:56.160
Please excuse me.

00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:58.800
Khun Yai!

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:00.160
Khun Yai!

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:06.920
What is it?

00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:10.680
It's something urgent. Please go to
Luang Sanor's place right now, sir.

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:18.856
I must go now.

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:21.240
I have an urgent matter to
discuss with Luang Sanor.

00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:23.720
Let's go, Saen.

00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:38.896
I'm sorry, sir.

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:42.296
Since Luang Sanor already
knows about our plan,

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:45.440
I don't see any other way that's
better and safer than using this place.

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:50.160
Luang Sanor is waiting for
you, sir. This way, please.

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:13.760
What is his condition so far?

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:20.360
I've asked a trusted foreign
doctor to check on him earlier.

00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:22.936
It's quite serious.

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:25.320
He's still unconscious.

00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:35.120
Sir, Master Prom is here.

00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:37.960
Kan, go stall time for me.

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:40.840
Tell him I'll be there after
I'm done with my business.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Yes, sir.

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:51.040
My apologies for pulling
you into this mess, Uncle.

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:57.040
Why would you apologise? I'm
willing to do anything for our country.

00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:03.640
Saen told me you sent him
to spy on them, is that right?

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:17.200
Saen.

00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:18.016
Yes, sir.

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:19.040
Tell him.

00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:26.160
Before he passed out, he said
he already got the name list.

00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:30.000
But I don't know where he keeps it. I've
searched his body but couldn't find anything.

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:33.560
We'll find out when he's awake.

00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:47.200
Your drink, sir.

00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:56.816
Please wait a moment.

00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:59.040
I already told Luang Sanor you're here.

00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:09.080
He got beaten up so badly. I think they
might already find it suspicious somehow.

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:13.240
I'm worried about his safety, Uncle.

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:18.856
Don't worry. I'll add more
guards and increase security.

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:20.600
Both day and night.

00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:22.280
No one will be able to get in.

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:24.520
Thank you, Uncle.

00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:35.680
Ruedee.

00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:39.320
Wait!

00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:54.520
[Next Episode] It seems Chao Meun
Sri Sorarak has something to tell us.

00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:55.880
Yes.

00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:00.840
Two days ago, a thief
broke into this place.

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:03.360
Didn't Luang Sanor say we
shouldn't tell anyone about it?

00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:04.400
Prom!

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:06.360
I'm worried and want to warn you.

00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:07.760
About what?

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:11.080
Some people are deceived by ideology.

00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:16.016
So much that they fail to notice some
paths might not lead them to glory.

00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:19.120
Whatever you'll do, always
think of Father and your family.

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.560
Khun Yai!

00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:25.496
Kaew!

00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:26.176
Kaew!

00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:26.960
Kaew!

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:28.720
What happened, Kaew?

00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:46.816
Everyone is watching the BEHIND THE SCENES…

00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:48.456
EP7!

00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:52.280
Oh wow, the weather is really
helping Khun Phra Nai flirt with Kaewta.

00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:53.257
Dead silent.

00:51:53.281 --> 00:51:55.600
Helping how? Feels more
like lightning's about to strike.

00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:57.616
How are you today?

00:51:57.640 --> 00:52:00.000
Today? I'm totally soaked from the rain.

00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:03.976
Got kissed.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.560
Hey, I was just trying to crack a joke.

00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:07.216
Got one kiss on the cheek.

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:09.440
Got kissed—maybe a bit too hard.

00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:11.656
How did I kiss you? Why is
my face bruised? Just you wait.

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:15.016
You got punched because you
tried to take advantage of me.

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:18.016
Well, you were about
to do that, so I had to…

00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:20.936
About to do what? What is “that”?

00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:23.960
But the wind keeps blowing
my hair into my mouth.

00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:28.256
For now, we're going to grab something
to eat. We don't have much time.

00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:29.416
Yeah. I - I have to go shoot again soon.

00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:31.256
Yeah. I - I'll excuse myself first.

00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:32.800
Please keep watching.

00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:02.440
Hello.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.240
He truly is beautiful.

00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:09.496
But Saen is very worried
about Khun Yai right now.

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:15.776
Because who knows if Khun Yai will flirt with
Kaew using old-fashioned jokes again? I'm worried.

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:17.400
So I rushed over to help Khun Yai.

00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:19.017
That last scene went well.

00:53:19.041 --> 00:53:23.176
I saw the fireworks being lit behind them while
they were locking eyes, like they were in a trance.

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:26.360
That scene was really beautiful. Like…

00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:31.240
You… you! You!

00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:16.960
Saen. I - Yeah, it's me.

00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:19.976
Do you get it? I - I do, P'Saen.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.360
Get out. Go!

00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:26.376
Someone was tailing Khun Phra-nai earlier.

00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:28.496
Saen couldn't let it
slide, so he handled it.

00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:30.456
Who taught you to be this aggressive?

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:33.640
Well, you kept walking around
without noticing anything.

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:36.896
He's Alfred. I'm Batman.

00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:39.896
- He'll take care of everything.
- That's true.

00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:42.480
- I'll carry it for you.
- Good.

00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:16.920
Damn it… why am I thinking about him?

00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:19.040
Kaew!

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:28.640
I've been looking for you everywhere.

00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:32.520
Why did you rush back as
soon as I went to see you?

00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:37.560
I don't know. And there's
nothing to know anyway.

00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:42.640
You sound like you're sulking at me.

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:45.600
Don't you know?

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.376
Aunt Payom.

00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:50.800
Mom!

00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:01.880
Never mind. I do.

00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:09.256
- Where did you learn English?
- I can understand a little.

00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:10.840
That's pretty good.
