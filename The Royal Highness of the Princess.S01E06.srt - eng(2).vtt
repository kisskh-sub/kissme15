00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:49.599
Just like that domineering Fifth Princess.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.239
Coveting our Meng Mansion's little black pig.

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:57.159
Stop playing dumb.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.560
Speak.

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:02.000
Why are you disguised as a maid?

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:03.840
Coming to our Meng Mansion to steal a pig?

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.239
A Lan is not playing dumb.

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:07.840
And she didn't steal any pig.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.240
You look so foolish and dim-witted.

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:20.599
A Lan is not dim-witted.

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:24.639
Don't be afraid.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.560
A Lan will take you to see a doctor.

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.680
He's sick.

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:31.919
He won't eat anything.

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:33.360
He won't drink anything.

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:35.000
He needs to see a doctor.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.639
Is that so?

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:50.439
He seems to be eating just fine.

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:55.400
Guards!

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.439
Young Master.

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:01.159
Throw this girl out of the mansion.

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:01.919
Yes.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.000
Stop eating.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.879
Young Master!

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:06.400
Look!

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.439
Blackie really is sick.

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:22.800
Blackie looks...

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.240
...a bit off today.

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:26.000
Perhaps he really is sick.

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:28.319
He really is sick.

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:31.919
It seems I wronged you.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.280
Yinglu asked you to take care of Blackie.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.360
And this is how you take care of him?

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.199
Cared for so well he won't eat or drink.

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.120
Looking utterly miserable.

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:47.240
With such negligence...

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.599
...what use are you staying in Meng Mansion?

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:53.479
Young Master! Young Master!

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.759
Young Master!

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:56.199
Your servant won't leave.

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:01.479
Don't drive your servant out of the mansion.

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:02.680
What's going on?

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.919
If I hadn't discovered it in time...

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.400
...Blackie would have been stolen by this girl.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.519
Young Lady.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:18.920
Blackie is sick.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.920
A Lan is taking him to see a doctor.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.480
A dimwit...

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:24.800
...but quite skilled at talking nonsense.

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:25.720
Brother.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.120
She's not talking nonsense.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.959
This is what the girl left in her room.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.680
"Blackie is sick."

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.079
"A Lan will take him to see a doctor."

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:42.920
From now on, if Blackie gets sick...

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:44.519
...you must tell me first.

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:45.399
Understood?

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.079
Pass down the order.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.199
Starting today...

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:56.000
...this girl is not allowed to take Blackie out of the mansion.

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:57.800
If he gets lost...

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.839
...it's no trivial matter.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.920
Yes.

00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:03.000
Thank you, Young Master.

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:04.920
But your servant is not dim-witted.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.920
She won't get lost.

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:08.240
This young master is worried about...

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.120
...Blackie getting lost.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.519
Since Blackie is sick...

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:27.519
...then this young lady will take him...

00:05:27.519 --> 00:05:28.360
...to see a doctor.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.360
What are you doing?

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.879
How dare you stop me!

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:34.240
Young Lady.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.920
Before the master left, he ordered...

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.199
...that you are not to leave the mansion casually.

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:40.079
This young lady needs to leave on official business.

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:42.439
The master specifically instructed...

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:45.040
...that even for official business, you cannot leave the mansion.

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:49.759
Fine, I won't go out then.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.000
Be smarter from now on.

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:57.319
Be careful, or this young lady will throw you out.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.680
Blackie will stay in my room tonight.

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:03.600
You feed him later.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.079
Blackie.

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:13.160
Blackie, be good.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:13.959
Eat.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.800
Being naughty again, are we?

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.360
Haven't seen you in a few days...

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.240
...and you've already sunk to being a maid in Meng Mansion.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.079
Truly impressive.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.120
Your anger subsided quite quickly.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.920
It's rare to see you in a predicament.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.319
Naturally, I had to come see the show.

00:06:31.079 --> 00:06:31.920
Let me tell you...

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.480
...I already know...

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.399
...when Blackie will meet his end.

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:36.560
Oh really?

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.680
You have that ability?

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.959
Look here.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.879
Blackie has a dark shadow between his brows.

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:44.240
His appetite isn't great either.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
How could a black pig's brow *not* be black?

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.680
According to my intuition...

00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:52.240
...Blackie's time of death is approaching.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.240
If nothing unexpected happens...

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.000
...it will be within the next few days.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.120
What "next few days"?

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.319
It's still a long way off.

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:04.680
Is that so?

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.680
Then I'm relieved.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.160
You're too cunning.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.120
You actually tricked me into talking.

00:07:13.519 --> 00:07:14.680
You're the only one allowed to trick me?

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:16.319
I'm not allowed to trick you back?

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.199
You...

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.839
Good luck to you.

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:22.399
Thanks.

00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:28.399
Blackie.

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:34.199
Yuwen Xiu must be anxiously sending people to search for me everywhere.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.399
Should I send him a message...

00:07:37.519 --> 00:07:38.360
...to let him know I'm safe?

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:44.360
Big Brother!

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:44.920
Young Master Xiu!

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:46.959
Big Brother! Young Master Xiu!

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:47.639
The lord is still sleeping.

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:48.040
Big Brother!

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:48.600
You mustn't...

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:49.759
Big Brother!

00:07:55.959 --> 00:07:56.399
Big Brother!

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:57.959
Big Brother!

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:58.639
I was wrong!

00:07:58.959 --> 00:07:59.399
Calm your anger!

00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:00.879
I... Big Brother, please calm down!

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.199
I was wrong, I was wrong!

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:02.959
I...

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:08.639
Young Master Xiu.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.600
It's not like you don't know...

00:08:11.879 --> 00:08:12.959
...when the lord is sleeping...

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.040
...he dislikes being disturbed the most.

00:08:14.279 --> 00:08:15.279
How could you forget?

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.079
I...

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:17.800
I was just anxious for a moment.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.240
I just...

00:08:28.079 --> 00:08:28.600
Big brother

00:08:29.519 --> 00:08:30.720
I've looked everywhere

00:08:30.959 --> 00:08:31.680
and couldn't find her anywhere.

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:37.360
Can the Fifth Princess survive outside the palace?

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.759
Will she have enough to eat and wear?

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.639
What if she encounters ruffians?

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.039
The world is a dangerous place.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.559
She's just a delicate woman.

00:08:46.039 --> 00:08:46.480
Big brother...

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:48.120
Please, help me out.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.600
I sent word to the palace

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.840
saying A Lan would stay at my mansion for a couple of days

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.960
and return her after the Drunken Immortal Tavern opens.

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:55.159
That's how I covered it up for now.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.600
If we still can't find her...

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.480
then... then I'm done for!

00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:04.120
Alright, I'll help you this once.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.639
This is the note received this morning.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:13.759
Seventh Cousin,

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.759
guess where A Lan is hiding?

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.000
Did you find the person who delivered the note?

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:23.840
Give the order.

00:09:24.519 --> 00:09:26.639
Have all Shadow Guards search for the Fifth Princess.

00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:27.679
My lord,

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.039
since the Fifth Princess could send someone with a note,

00:09:31.639 --> 00:09:33.840
it means she's at least safe for now.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.720
There's no need

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.200
to mobilize all Shadow Guards, is there?

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.240
Before tonight,

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:47.240
you must find the Fifth Princess.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:49.759
Yes, sir.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.639
Where are Ke Ren and Blackie?

00:10:06.039 --> 00:10:06.480
Come here.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.279
Let this young master give you a hug.

00:10:10.159 --> 00:10:12.279
You seem to have gained a lot of weight lately.

00:10:14.279 --> 00:10:15.879
Does the young master not like it?

00:10:18.759 --> 00:10:19.639
It's good to be plump.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.720
It feels nicer to the touch.

00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:24.919
As long as the young master is pleased.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.200
Morals are declining,

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.960
and people's hearts are not what they used to be.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.320
Meng Shaojue, in broad daylight,

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.279
right in front of Blackie, with Ke Ren...

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:55.279
What have you been eating lately

00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:56.080
to get this fat?

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.080
The same as usual.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.000
I don't know why I gained weight.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.080
Oh, he was talking about Blackie.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:03.960
Who's there?

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:13.919
Young master!

00:11:14.639 --> 00:11:15.519
It's you.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:25.759
So idle

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.840
that you come here to eavesdrop?

00:11:33.759 --> 00:11:34.519
Young master!

00:11:34.759 --> 00:11:36.000
You molested your servant!

00:11:44.039 --> 00:11:45.120
With your looks,

00:11:45.879 --> 00:11:47.519
what's there for this young master to molest?

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.480
Young master,

00:11:56.759 --> 00:11:58.399
it's time for Blackie's bath.

00:12:09.519 --> 00:12:10.039
Let's go.

00:12:10.279 --> 00:12:10.639
Brother!

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.399
I have important business outside the mansion today.

00:12:16.159 --> 00:12:17.279
Can you talk to the guards for me?

00:12:17.519 --> 00:12:18.480
They'll definitely listen to you.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.120
What important business could you have?

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.320
The poetry book Father told me to copy is lost.

00:12:23.879 --> 00:12:24.840
I'm going to buy a new one.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.399
I have several more in my room.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:28.919
Go get one later.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:30.919
Brother...

00:12:32.759 --> 00:12:33.159
Young master,

00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:34.919
the Chief Grand Secretary and the Fourth Princess have arrived.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.000
What are they here for?

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.200
Young Master Meng.

00:12:52.039 --> 00:12:53.399
The Chief Grand Secretary and I are here

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.039
to investigate the incident involving the assassin from the Flying Immortal Pavilion.

00:12:56.799 --> 00:12:58.360
Were you at the Flying Immortal Pavilion that night,

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.720
Young Master Meng? Did you notice anyone suspicious?

00:13:02.279 --> 00:13:03.159
Think carefully.

00:13:04.039 --> 00:13:04.840
Actually, yes.

00:13:05.679 --> 00:13:06.080
Who?

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.720
Why, it's naturally the ruthless one

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.120
who wouldn't even spare a little black pig.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.759
Chief Grand Secretary.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.000
The Chief Grand Secretary is highly capable,

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.519
and a perfect match for the vicious, domineering Fifth Princess.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.039
Truly a perfect pair.

00:13:30.879 --> 00:13:31.879
Vicious and domineering?

00:13:32.639 --> 00:13:33.240
Young Master Meng,

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.320
you mustn't speak carelessly.

00:13:35.679 --> 00:13:37.000
Isn't that the truth?

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.480
For you to openly slander the Fifth Princess

00:13:41.919 --> 00:13:42.679
is not appropriate, is it?

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.000
And meeting dance girls at the Flying Immortal Pavilion at night—

00:13:45.639 --> 00:13:47.799
does the Chief Grand Secretary find that appropriate?

00:13:51.759 --> 00:13:53.279
Meeting dance girls at night?

00:14:06.039 --> 00:14:08.720
Since Young Master Meng has no useful information,

00:14:09.279 --> 00:14:10.240
we shall take our leave.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:11.639
Young Master Meng,

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.000
I heard your mansion has a

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.559
rare Sacred Fruit Tree from the southern mountains,

00:14:15.559 --> 00:14:17.480
seen only once in a hundred years.

00:14:17.919 --> 00:14:19.120
Could you show it to me?

00:14:55.879 --> 00:14:57.759
Ke Ren, brother was just looking for you.

00:14:57.759 --> 00:14:58.360
You should go quickly.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.120
Yes, miss.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:15.399
Heaven helps me!

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.080
I didn't expect you to be so interested in the Sacred Fruit Tree.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:28.799
Brother!

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:39.480
My lord,

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:40.559
this way, please.

00:15:58.879 --> 00:16:00.120
Perhaps we should see the fruit tree another day.

00:16:00.279 --> 00:16:02.240
We should focus on the investigation of the Flying Immortal Pavilion assassin first.

00:16:02.799 --> 00:16:03.720
Imperial Sister,

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.360
a little delay won't hurt.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.240
Yuwen Xiu!

00:16:08.639 --> 00:16:09.200
Ouch!

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:33.399
Who's there?

00:16:34.159 --> 00:16:34.799
Come out now!

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.440
Must I personally invite you out?

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:54.480
Come here at once!

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:10.920
Yinglu!

00:17:11.039 --> 00:17:11.759
Take that basket off.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.880
Pay your respects to the Fourth Princess and the Chief Grand Secretary.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:18.720
Brother,

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:20.279
I'm Ke Ren.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:22.240
Brother,

00:17:22.559 --> 00:17:23.880
I'm Ke Ren too.

00:17:31.319 --> 00:17:31.920
Young Master Meng,

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.400
the people in your mansion are quite amusing.

00:17:37.279 --> 00:17:38.359
Please excuse us, Fourth Princess.

00:17:40.319 --> 00:17:40.960
Enough, Ke Ren.

00:17:41.519 --> 00:17:42.200
Take the basket off.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:46.759
Hurry up and take it off!

00:17:51.359 --> 00:17:51.960
Brother Blackie,

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:52.759
sorry about this.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.519
Blackie ran away!

00:17:56.519 --> 00:17:57.640
Go, hurry and catch Blackie!

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.119
Quickly!

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:03.960
My younger sister is mischievous.

00:18:04.359 --> 00:18:04.960
Please excuse her.

00:18:25.319 --> 00:18:26.359
Are you okay?

00:18:26.519 --> 00:18:28.599
Why are you hiding in that vat with Blackie?

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.079
Quiet.

00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:32.240
Blackie likes to sleep there.

00:18:33.839 --> 00:18:34.599
What a dummy.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.480
About me climbing the wall...

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.799
You mustn't tell anyone.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:39.839
Understood?

00:18:42.119 --> 00:18:42.559
Alright, alright.

00:18:42.799 --> 00:18:43.640
Go find Blackie now.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.039
Blackie.

00:18:47.319 --> 00:18:48.079
Blackie.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:49.519
Blackie.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:50.880
Blackie.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.160
About meeting the dancer at night...

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:00.519
Elder Cousin.

00:19:01.359 --> 00:19:01.880
What do you have to say?

00:19:05.039 --> 00:19:06.839
You are currently engaged to A Lan.

00:19:07.599 --> 00:19:08.400
Meeting a dancer at night...

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.160
Where does that leave A Lan?

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.240
It's not what you think.

00:19:15.359 --> 00:19:16.759
A Lan is naive and innocent now.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.559
If you, Elder Cousin, are a womanizer...

00:19:19.759 --> 00:19:20.880
A philanderer who leaves a trail of broken hearts...

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.839
I will do everything in my power...

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.519
To stop your marriage to A Lan.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.839
The Fourth Princess will not get that chance.

00:19:28.759 --> 00:19:30.279
As for the others who were at the Flying Immortal Pavilion...

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.160
I'll trouble the Fourth Princess to investigate them.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.319
Sir, how did it go?

00:19:43.039 --> 00:19:44.519
The Meng Mansion is heavily guarded.

00:19:45.279 --> 00:19:46.160
I'll come again tonight.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:47.880
And the Fifth Princess?

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:48.799
Any news?

00:19:50.559 --> 00:19:51.720
I had the Shadow Guards investigate.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:52.640
We only know...

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.480
The Fifth Princess was last seen at Shunshun Gambling Den.

00:19:57.279 --> 00:19:58.000
How many men did you send?

00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.079
Don't worry about that, sir.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:00.240
Just one.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:01.880
One?

00:20:03.519 --> 00:20:04.640
I've thought it over carefully.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.359
Sir, you don't like the Fifth Princess.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.480
And you're eager to cancel the engagement with her.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:09.519
So how could you...

00:20:09.519 --> 00:20:11.119
Truly care about the Fifth Princess's safety?

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.519
When you told me to mobilize all Shadow Guards...

00:20:13.759 --> 00:20:14.359
That was merely...

00:20:14.359 --> 00:20:15.880
Empty words for Young Master Xiu's benefit.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.160
Rest assured, sir.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.160
I understand completely.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.000
If there's still no news of the Fifth Princess by tonight...

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.599
You will depart for the Northern Territories.

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:26.039
This...

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:28.599
Sir...

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.160
The Northern Territories, they...

00:20:31.519 --> 00:20:32.759
They're covered in snow year-round.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.640
Not suitable for someone as cold-averse as me.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.799
Precisely because it's unsuitable, I'm sending you.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:41.640
Sir!

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:42.599
Then...

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:52.519
Could the Fifth Princess...

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.359
Have gone to work as a maid in some mansion?

00:20:58.599 --> 00:20:59.839
She's not actually foolish.

00:21:00.559 --> 00:21:02.039
Why would she give up being a princess...

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.519
To be a maid?

00:21:08.839 --> 00:21:10.279
Move this wine inside.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.079
Right away!

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:11.759
Be careful!

00:21:13.039 --> 00:21:13.960
Wipe this cleaner.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:14.799
Got it!

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.119
Stop working.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.039
Go home and rest.

00:21:17.799 --> 00:21:18.160
Huh?

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.119
What's wrong, young master?

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:23.599
I'm in a bad mood.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:24.559
I don't want to open.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:25.599
But...

00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:27.799
Seventh Cousin!

00:21:28.359 --> 00:21:29.039
A Zi.

00:21:29.519 --> 00:21:30.160
Everyone, stop working.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:30.799
Go inside.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.880
I was just on my way to investigate the Flying Immortal Pavilion incident.

00:21:34.279 --> 00:21:34.960
And happened to pass by.

00:21:35.559 --> 00:21:36.160
Is A Lan here?

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:37.359
I'll go see her.

00:21:38.359 --> 00:21:39.839
A Lan is still sleeping.

00:21:39.839 --> 00:21:40.559
Don't wake her.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.160
Your tavern opens tomorrow, right?

00:21:45.519 --> 00:21:46.119
Tell A Lan...

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.160
I'll be here tomorrow too.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.119
Aren't you investigating the assassin?

00:21:49.519 --> 00:21:51.000
It's fine if you don't come.

00:21:51.599 --> 00:21:53.079
For my Seventh Cousin's tavern opening...

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.160
Of course I must attend.

00:21:55.839 --> 00:21:57.039
I have other matters, I must go.

00:22:05.599 --> 00:22:06.039
Young master...

00:22:06.839 --> 00:22:08.599
Are we still opening tomorrow?

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:31.759
Don't run!

00:22:31.759 --> 00:22:32.160
Stop right there!

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:41.519
Blackie.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.039
Blackie.

00:22:45.319 --> 00:22:46.000
Blackie.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.599
So it really is you.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.400
In the dead of night...

00:22:57.599 --> 00:22:58.599
What is Your Excellency doing?

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.400
In the dead of night...

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.559
What is the Fifth Princess doing?

00:23:16.519 --> 00:23:17.519
I certainly didn't expect...

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.880
The Fifth Princess to become a maid at the Meng Mansion.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:22.839
I didn't expect either...

00:23:23.319 --> 00:23:25.759
Your Excellency to take up trespassing.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.039
After not seeing you for a few days...

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.519
You've become quite sharp-tongued.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:30.920
Your Excellency.

00:23:31.119 --> 00:23:31.720
You mind your business.

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:32.400
I'll mind mine.

00:23:32.599 --> 00:23:33.279
Why come to the Meng Mansion?

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:35.599
A twist of fate.

00:23:36.079 --> 00:23:37.680
Just came to the Meng Mansion for fun.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:39.759
Playing at being a maid.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.319
The palace is so boring.

00:23:43.599 --> 00:23:44.000
I...

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.279
Zi Xiu is sending people everywhere to look for you.

00:23:48.759 --> 00:23:49.880
Later, I'll take you back to the palace.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.759
I'll return on my own in a couple of days.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.160
I'd appreciate it if you didn't reveal my whereabouts.

00:24:20.519 --> 00:24:23.319
The Meng Mansion is quite lively tonight.

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.000
Assassin!

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.079
There's an assassin!

00:24:27.839 --> 00:24:28.359
Over here!

00:24:29.759 --> 00:24:30.200
Quickly!

00:24:30.519 --> 00:24:31.559
The assassin went that way!

00:24:31.559 --> 00:24:32.160
This way, hurry!

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:35.000
The assassin outside, is he one of your men?

00:24:35.599 --> 00:24:37.119
My men aren't that clumsy.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.279
To be discovered so easily.

00:24:42.079 --> 00:24:43.559
Could it be Prince Ning's men?

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.119
Your Excellency should hurry and figure out how to leave.

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:49.880
Young master!

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.039
The assassin is coming this way!

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.119
Quick!

00:24:57.039 --> 00:24:57.599
Search the area!

00:26:08.079 --> 00:26:09.759
Young master, the assassin is here!

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.279
He hasn't gone far!

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:24.880
Don't move.

00:26:30.319 --> 00:26:30.759
Halt!

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.240
He's gone.

00:26:53.279 --> 00:26:54.119
It's getting late.

00:26:54.359 --> 00:26:55.880
Your Excellency should leave as soon as possible.

00:26:57.519 --> 00:26:58.240
If you want to play,

00:26:59.359 --> 00:26:59.960
I promise you

00:27:00.319 --> 00:27:01.720
I won't reveal your whereabouts for now.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.279
If you haven't returned to the palace in three days,

00:27:05.279 --> 00:27:06.920
I will forcibly bring you back.

00:27:11.319 --> 00:27:12.920
After all, Meng Mansion is not as safe as the palace.

00:27:14.119 --> 00:27:15.640
Fine, I understand.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.359
Take care, my lord.

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:23.640
None of your business.

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.880
Your Highness, Meng Mansion is heavily guarded.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.559
Barging in to search for the map would be unwise.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:40.720
You may withdraw to tend to your wounds.

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:41.880
Yes.

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.839
It seems then

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.640
it's better to wait until Meng Shaojue's birthday

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.720
to infiltrate Meng Mansion and search for the map.

00:27:59.519 --> 00:27:59.920
My lord.

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:01.119
My lord.

00:28:01.359 --> 00:28:02.720
I have failed in my duty.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.279
I have yet to locate the Fifth Princess.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:16.319
My lord.

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.440
Have you found the map?

00:28:23.359 --> 00:28:24.559
It's fine. Have some tea first.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:25.759
This tea,

00:28:26.079 --> 00:28:28.160
I had someone replace the pot every half-stick of incense,

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.119
so you'd have a hot cup as soon as you returned.

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.480
Why are you still at the mansion so late?

00:28:38.799 --> 00:28:40.079
Are you hungry, my lord?

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.799
I'll go to the kitchen to see if there's any food.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:43.640
You can depart for the Northern Territories.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:50.680
My lord...

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.839
I don't want to go.

00:28:58.519 --> 00:28:59.480
I understand.

00:28:59.839 --> 00:29:01.799
I'll go pack my things now.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:03.680
The Fifth Princess has been found.

00:29:05.319 --> 00:29:05.680
Really?

00:29:06.519 --> 00:29:06.920
My lord!

00:29:07.279 --> 00:29:08.079
Where is she?

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.240
Does that mean I don't have to go to the Northern Territories?

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:12.440
Inform Zixiu

00:29:12.759 --> 00:29:13.640
that the Fifth Princess has been found.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:14.279
She is perfectly safe.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.680
I will bring her back to the palace within three days.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:19.519
I'll see to it immediately.

00:29:35.319 --> 00:29:35.720
Brother.

00:29:36.359 --> 00:29:37.920
I heard there was an assassin in the mansion last night.

00:29:40.759 --> 00:29:42.279
What kind of assassin is so brazen

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.039
as to dare come to our Meng Mansion?

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:45.079
Brother,

00:29:45.599 --> 00:29:46.440
leave this to me.

00:29:46.759 --> 00:29:47.640
I'll go dig him out.

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.480
Finish copying this poetry collection first.

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.640
From now on, don't let this girl take care of Blackie.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:09.480
Young Master.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.559
Your servant enjoys taking care of Blackie.

00:30:12.279 --> 00:30:13.039
That's right, brother.

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:15.599
Blackie seems to like her too.

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.880
What does a pig know about liking or disliking?

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.799
Blackie will stay in my courtyard from now on.

00:30:24.079 --> 00:30:24.480
Keqing.

00:30:25.839 --> 00:30:26.200
Yes.

00:30:41.039 --> 00:30:42.759
That servant Shuncai still hasn't been found?

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:45.960
He truly has no conscience.

00:30:46.279 --> 00:30:47.240
Brother treated him well,

00:30:47.839 --> 00:30:49.440
yet he stole your dagger.

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.400
That was the last birthday gift

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.240
Mother gave you before she passed.

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.799
Shuncai stole the dagger,

00:30:56.599 --> 00:30:57.599
so he'll surely pawn it.

00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.240
Go check the major pawnshops.

00:30:59.799 --> 00:31:00.480
Yes, Young Master.

00:31:05.799 --> 00:31:06.200
Brother,

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:09.599
aren't you going to that place today...

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.559
the Drunken Immortal Tavern?

00:31:16.839 --> 00:31:17.720
You want to go too?

00:31:19.039 --> 00:31:19.960
Of course not!

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.039
I still have to copy the poetry collection.

00:31:34.599 --> 00:31:35.000
Hurry up.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:39.960
Miss.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.759
Your servant doesn't want to leave the mansion.

00:31:41.759 --> 00:31:43.279
Your servant wants to take care of Blackie.

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:45.519
Keep your voice down.

00:31:45.799 --> 00:31:47.200
If we're discovered, we won't get out.

00:31:49.039 --> 00:31:49.440
Hurry.

00:31:49.559 --> 00:31:50.559
The guards will be back soon.

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:55.279
If you dare leak my affairs

00:31:55.279 --> 00:31:56.200
like the other maids did,

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.200
this young lady will definitely throw you out.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.759
Your servant will obey you in everything, Miss.

00:32:02.319 --> 00:32:02.720
Let's go.

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:09.759
In all these years,

00:32:09.759 --> 00:32:11.839
when have the Four Young Masters of Yunmi ever gathered?

00:32:11.839 --> 00:32:12.440
Exactly!

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:13.920
How come the opening of the Drunken Immortal Tavern

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.640
can bring all Four Young Masters together?

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000
That's naturally because

00:32:17.319 --> 00:32:18.440
the owner of the Drunken Immortal Tavern...

00:32:18.799 --> 00:32:19.839
The Four Young Masters are here!

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:21.759
The Four Young Masters are here!

00:32:22.079 --> 00:32:27.640
Four Young Masters! Four Young Masters! Four Young Masters!

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.759
The Four Young Masters of Yunmi really have a grand presence.

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:08.640
Don't let brother find us.

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:10.480
Lord He.

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:11.079
Lord He.

00:33:11.319 --> 00:33:11.680
Eldest Brother.

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:13.359
Fifth...

00:33:13.359 --> 00:33:15.200
Will that thing really return to the palace in three days?

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:15.599
Mm-hmm.

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.720
When the Fourth Princess asks...

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:18.880
Don't worry, Eldest Brother.

00:33:19.519 --> 00:33:20.240
Four Young Masters!

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:21.000
Young Master Xiu!

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:21.960
I wrote a poem for you!

00:33:22.759 --> 00:33:23.319
Young Master Meng!

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.359
I wrote you a letter!

00:33:24.599 --> 00:33:25.920
I wrote a letter too!

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:26.440
This is mine!

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:30.880
Four Young Masters! Four Young Masters! Four Young Masters!

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.480
Lord He is indeed as the rumors say:

00:33:32.559 --> 00:33:34.200
Majestic and peerless in the world.

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.960
Miss Meng is actually a stan of He Lianchen.

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.039
Four Young Masters! Four Young Masters! Four Young Masters!

00:33:40.039 --> 00:33:41.000
Young Master Meng, this is my letter!

00:33:41.039 --> 00:33:42.079
A Zi, you're here.

00:33:42.839 --> 00:33:43.400
Where's A Lan?

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.200
A Lan? She knew Eldest Brother was coming today,

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.200
so she was too excited to sleep last night.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.319
She only fell asleep this morning.

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:48.519
I really couldn't bear to wake her.

00:33:48.519 --> 00:33:51.240
Four Young Masters! Four Young Masters! Four Young Masters!

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.480
A Lan is so devoted to him,

00:33:52.799 --> 00:33:53.799
yet he still meets with dancing girls at night.

00:33:54.079 --> 00:33:54.599
What did you say?

00:33:54.599 --> 00:33:56.279
Four Young Masters! Four Young Masters! Four Young Masters!

00:33:56.279 --> 00:33:56.799
Nothing.

00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:58.079
Eldest Brother.

00:33:58.319 --> 00:33:59.039
Brother Meng, Brother He.

00:33:59.279 --> 00:33:59.799
Go on.

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.880
Where did you come from? What are you doing?

00:34:09.519 --> 00:34:10.440
Lord Yuwen!

00:34:10.559 --> 00:34:12.159
This young lady didn't mean to!

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:13.559
If apologies were useful,

00:34:14.079 --> 00:34:15.360
what would we need constables and bailiffs for?

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:28.599
Come, please.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:33.320
Fourth Young Master! Fourth Young Master! Fourth Young Master!

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:34.519
As expected of Lord He.

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.920
Honorable and impartial.

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.039
Young lady.

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:39.800
The young master will find out.

00:34:40.199 --> 00:34:42.360
We've changed our clothes and are wearing veils.

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:43.079
How would my brother find out?

00:34:43.079 --> 00:34:47.840
Fourth Young Master! Fourth Young Master! Fourth Young Master!

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:49.199
Thank you, everyone.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:51.800
Today, my Drunken Immortal Tavern opens.

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.760
All food and drink are half price.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:59.840
Great! Great! Great!

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:00.360
Come on in.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:07.559
Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!

00:35:07.559 --> 00:35:07.960
Everyone.

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.039
Please, come inside.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:10.639
You three, please.

00:35:18.079 --> 00:35:18.639
Young master.

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.119
I just found out.

00:35:20.599 --> 00:35:21.760
Yuwen Xiu specifically prepared for Meng Shaojue...

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:22.480
...a pot of wine.

00:35:23.159 --> 00:35:24.599
I put the item in that pot of wine.

00:35:25.159 --> 00:35:27.239
Last time, Meng Shaojue ruined my plans.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.719
This time, I'll make him know...

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.440
...this young master's power.
