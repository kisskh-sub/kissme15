00:01:40.584 --> 00:01:42.337
So

00:01:43.238 --> 00:01:45.474
it's not that you're too lazy
to have breakfast,

00:01:45.474 --> 00:01:47.475
you just don't eat breakfast at all?

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:52.480
Intermittent fasting.

00:01:59.288 --> 00:02:01.222
So it's not that you failed...

00:02:02.105 --> 00:02:04.485
to get your license,
you just never bothered to get one?

00:02:06.839 --> 00:02:08.449
Well...

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:11.132
It's my way of cutting down
on carbon emissions.

00:02:13.878 --> 00:02:15.637
So it's not

00:02:17.505 --> 00:02:20.008
like you couldn't date, you just didn't?

00:02:23.445 --> 00:02:26.298
Then why did you change your mind?

00:02:26.298 --> 00:02:28.416
You said we should take it slow.

00:02:28.951 --> 00:02:31.687
Anyone hearing this would think
we slept together.

00:02:31.687 --> 00:02:35.758
We didn't sleep together,
but we did fall asleep in the same space.

00:02:35.758 --> 00:02:37.459
I mean,

00:02:38.138 --> 00:02:40.629
getting to know someone

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.833
includes knowing their space.

00:02:46.852 --> 00:02:48.706
So

00:02:48.706 --> 00:02:50.372
how was it?

00:03:09.892 --> 00:03:12.939
I expected to see
sheet music scattered everywhere,

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:15.497
the smell of old takeout,

00:03:15.497 --> 00:03:17.900
and everything reeking of cigarettes...

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.302
I thought you'd be living like some zombie
with a flipped schedule.

00:03:22.756 --> 00:03:24.606
So, you're disappointed?

00:03:25.757 --> 00:03:29.611
Well, my fantasy of musicians fell apart.

00:03:38.658 --> 00:03:40.889
After the tea ceremony today,

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.992
you'll have a Jeju silver hairtail set dinner.

00:03:43.992 --> 00:03:45.794
Then back to the resort

00:03:45.794 --> 00:03:47.975
for a spa massage.

00:03:47.975 --> 00:03:50.378
That's the final schedule for today.

00:03:50.378 --> 00:03:54.369
Please unpack and rest in your rooms.

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:55.838
We'll meet back here at noon.

00:03:55.838 --> 00:03:56.638
See you later.

00:03:56.638 --> 00:03:57.840
- Okay.
- Thanks for your hard work.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.224
- Yes.
- Thank you.

00:03:59.224 --> 00:04:01.209
Okay. Let's go.

00:04:05.414 --> 00:04:06.948
Excuse me.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.490
- Do I really have to join?
- Yes.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.288
Sorry?

00:04:12.288 --> 00:04:13.888
What do you mean?

00:04:14.923 --> 00:04:17.492
The meals and sightseeing.

00:04:17.492 --> 00:04:20.128
Those are all included in the fee.

00:04:20.128 --> 00:04:23.698
It's a premier-level package,
so you'll be satisfied.

00:04:24.933 --> 00:04:27.376
I'd rather rest.

00:04:27.376 --> 00:04:31.306
Normally, individual activities aren't allowed,

00:04:31.306 --> 00:04:33.609
but if you're staying behind,
please remain within the resort.

00:04:33.609 --> 00:04:37.245
We can't risk you going out and getting hurt.

00:05:11.914 --> 00:05:15.203
[Happy 35th Wedding Anniversary]

00:05:16.364 --> 00:05:18.553
You slept with him?

00:05:20.923 --> 00:05:24.572
You acted all aloof, playing hard to get.

00:05:24.572 --> 00:05:27.495
We just slept.

00:05:29.898 --> 00:05:31.705
I swear, we literally just slept.
Just sleeping, nothing else.

00:05:31.705 --> 00:05:34.369
No touching at all? Just sleep?

00:05:34.369 --> 00:05:36.771
- Yeah.
- Is that even possible?

00:05:38.573 --> 00:05:41.224
We decided to take things slow.

00:05:41.224 --> 00:05:43.678
Take things slow?

00:05:44.461 --> 00:05:47.950
Cold-blooded Seo Jun Kyung
and he, a broke musician,

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.819
did you two seriously agree to postpone sex?

00:05:53.922 --> 00:05:55.872
Well,

00:05:55.872 --> 00:05:57.792
that's how it ended up, anyway.

00:05:59.895 --> 00:06:02.901
Is that something
a gynecology specialist should be saying?

00:06:02.901 --> 00:06:04.967
Are we supposed to encourage sex?

00:06:04.967 --> 00:06:07.833
Of all the things to postpone... seriously?

00:06:07.833 --> 00:06:12.207
Wow, the laziest couple ever.

00:06:12.207 --> 00:06:13.606
Then

00:06:13.606 --> 00:06:16.544
what did you do all night long?

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:19.633
Well,

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:22.884
we drank,

00:06:23.618 --> 00:06:25.332
and talked.

00:06:31.572 --> 00:06:34.896
He's my polar opposite.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.732
That's all I figured out.

00:06:43.338 --> 00:06:45.673
But somehow,

00:06:46.241 --> 00:06:49.003
that difference didn't bother me
as much as I thought.

00:06:54.272 --> 00:06:56.117
You two did it, right?

00:06:57.451 --> 00:06:59.421
Would you believe that if it were you?

00:06:59.421 --> 00:07:02.657
You can't even sleep at home,
yet you slept like a baby at his place?

00:07:02.657 --> 00:07:05.593
Nothing else?

00:07:09.606 --> 00:07:11.274
I know.

00:07:11.274 --> 00:07:12.734
How did I even sleep that deeply?

00:07:12.734 --> 00:07:14.769
In someone else's house, of all places.

00:07:37.692 --> 00:07:38.924
Anyway,

00:07:38.924 --> 00:07:41.029
don't tell anyone.

00:07:41.602 --> 00:07:44.679
Like there's even anything to tell.

00:07:45.569 --> 00:07:46.802
Did you know?

00:07:46.802 --> 00:07:48.603
What?

00:07:50.806 --> 00:07:53.408
Dr. Hong skipped lunch today, not for dieting,

00:07:53.408 --> 00:07:55.644
but because she fought with her boyfriend.

00:07:55.644 --> 00:07:56.878
Seriously?

00:07:56.878 --> 00:07:59.113
No way.

00:08:01.016 --> 00:08:02.944
There's that smile.

00:08:02.944 --> 00:08:06.020
Even if it's a bit awkward, it's been days.

00:08:19.205 --> 00:08:21.272
Hey, let's go eat.

00:08:21.272 --> 00:08:24.073
- Let's go together.
- Let's go together.

00:08:24.073 --> 00:08:25.707
Hurry up.

00:08:28.165 --> 00:08:30.745
I don't have practice today. Where are you?

00:08:33.815 --> 00:08:36.050
Why are you ignoring my texts?

00:08:36.551 --> 00:08:38.519
You ignored my calls too.

00:08:44.697 --> 00:08:46.861
Why are you sulking?

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.026
Who is sulking?

00:08:49.026 --> 00:08:50.606
Fine, then I'm leaving.

00:08:50.606 --> 00:08:52.300
Hey.

00:08:52.968 --> 00:08:54.769
Yes,

00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:56.005
I am sulking.

00:08:56.005 --> 00:08:58.000
So what is it? What are you upset about?

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.142
Who's that guy?

00:09:00.142 --> 00:09:01.710
Who?

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:03.111
That guy.

00:09:03.111 --> 00:09:04.746
He looks so sleazy,

00:09:04.746 --> 00:09:06.848
posting photos of you all over his feed.

00:09:06.848 --> 00:09:08.583
Oh, Beom Jun?

00:09:09.751 --> 00:09:12.053
You're cute.

00:09:12.788 --> 00:09:14.522
Come here.

00:09:16.758 --> 00:09:18.761
What are you doing?

00:09:18.761 --> 00:09:20.661
Look at this.

00:09:22.998 --> 00:09:25.032
"He's my everything."

00:09:27.469 --> 00:09:29.038
I posted it.

00:09:29.038 --> 00:09:30.172
Are you happy now?

00:09:30.172 --> 00:09:31.373
- You are, right?
- No.

00:09:31.373 --> 00:09:33.808
You totally are!

00:09:34.576 --> 00:09:35.945
Estonia?

00:09:35.945 --> 00:09:37.312
You've been there?

00:09:37.312 --> 00:09:38.912
Yeah.

00:09:39.397 --> 00:09:41.449
When? With who?

00:09:43.585 --> 00:09:45.037
There you go again, getting suspicious.

00:09:45.037 --> 00:09:47.122
The year before last, with my team for a show.

00:09:47.122 --> 00:09:48.790
Oh...

00:09:50.414 --> 00:09:54.535
First, at the nicest restaurant
in the Old Town,

00:09:54.535 --> 00:09:57.465
I invite everyone I know for round one.

00:09:57.465 --> 00:09:58.600
Yeah.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.102
Then we head downtown
to the hottest club for round two.

00:10:01.102 --> 00:10:02.550
Yeah.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:04.372
And then,

00:10:04.372 --> 00:10:06.073
back to the hotel,

00:10:06.073 --> 00:10:08.975
just you and me, a totally steamy round three.

00:10:08.975 --> 00:10:10.315
What is that?

00:10:10.315 --> 00:10:12.213
Well? Huh?

00:10:12.814 --> 00:10:14.316
But seriously,

00:10:14.316 --> 00:10:17.952
why throw a birthday party
all the way out there?

00:10:19.861 --> 00:10:21.305
It's just

00:10:21.305 --> 00:10:23.739
my dream.

00:10:23.739 --> 00:10:25.460
Geez.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:27.060
Hey.

00:10:30.131 --> 00:10:32.434
Anything else besides that?

00:10:32.434 --> 00:10:34.047
Huh?

00:10:34.621 --> 00:10:36.172
If I say it,

00:10:36.172 --> 00:10:37.939
will you do it for me?

00:11:00.462 --> 00:11:02.530
Oh, no way.

00:11:47.475 --> 00:11:48.977
Yes, Dad.

00:11:48.977 --> 00:11:50.591
Yeah.

00:11:51.658 --> 00:11:53.614
I feel like I shouldn't have come.

00:11:54.282 --> 00:11:56.417
I should've just listened to Jun Seo.

00:12:00.007 --> 00:12:02.390
You went on a trip?

00:12:03.355 --> 00:12:05.327
I bet you don't get me, do you?

00:12:05.327 --> 00:12:07.040
Given everything going on right now.

00:12:10.501 --> 00:12:12.867
I just felt like doing it anyway.

00:12:15.088 --> 00:12:17.004
I understand.

00:12:21.751 --> 00:12:23.577
Did you get off work?

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.548
I'm about to.

00:12:26.548 --> 00:12:29.650
I wonder if Jun Seo is at least eating.

00:12:30.252 --> 00:12:32.144
- A home party?
- Yeah.

00:12:32.144 --> 00:12:35.423
Not one of those boring
store-rented birthday parties.

00:12:35.423 --> 00:12:37.126
A real birthday party.

00:12:37.126 --> 00:12:39.427
But my place is too small.

00:12:40.462 --> 00:12:41.196
What do you think?

00:12:41.196 --> 00:12:44.198
Your dad is away traveling,
so no one is home, right?

00:12:53.608 --> 00:12:55.144
Why?

00:12:55.144 --> 00:12:56.879
You don't like it?

00:12:56.879 --> 00:12:58.722
It's just...

00:12:58.722 --> 00:13:02.217
I'm not sure if I'm in a place
where I should do that.

00:13:02.217 --> 00:13:05.052
It hasn't been long since my mom passed away.

00:13:05.742 --> 00:13:09.591
You know my situation right now,
it's just... My situation.

00:13:09.591 --> 00:13:11.426
Huh?

00:13:11.426 --> 00:13:13.829
He's sick too,
and he'll be alone at home anyway.

00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:16.564
Eating alone is really lonely.

00:13:17.533 --> 00:13:19.301
Make sure you eat dinner too.

00:13:19.301 --> 00:13:21.168
Yes. You too, Dad.

00:13:35.729 --> 00:13:37.505
Did you

00:13:37.505 --> 00:13:39.453
get some rest?

00:13:40.589 --> 00:13:42.591
Yeah, thanks to you.

00:13:42.591 --> 00:13:45.850
I asked the restaurant,
and they said you didn't eat.

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:47.729
Eating alone didn't feel right.

00:13:47.729 --> 00:13:48.864
Right?

00:13:48.864 --> 00:13:51.600
That's why people stick together in groups.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.935
This is abalone gimbap.
You should be able to eat it.

00:13:56.105 --> 00:13:57.690
Here.

00:14:01.142 --> 00:14:03.844
Abalone in gimbap, huh.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.615
Tomorrow, you'll be with us all day.

00:14:16.558 --> 00:14:19.093
Oh, I already checked.

00:14:20.762 --> 00:14:23.764
Yeah, it should be fine.

00:14:32.307 --> 00:14:33.842
Oh, okay.

00:14:33.842 --> 00:14:37.878
I'll put it together
and send it over by tomorrow morning.

00:14:38.747 --> 00:14:40.440
They call themselves a writer,

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.784
yet misspellings
aren't something to brag about.

00:14:42.784 --> 00:14:44.385
Seriously.

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:56.236
Geez.

00:14:58.767 --> 00:15:00.353
Hey.

00:15:01.102 --> 00:15:03.238
Sorry, but I have to work.

00:15:03.238 --> 00:15:05.339
I can't eat with you.

00:15:14.315 --> 00:15:16.078
Have you been to Estonia?

00:15:16.078 --> 00:15:18.537
I want to go. The Baltic states.

00:15:18.537 --> 00:15:21.073
Someone goes to Estonia,

00:15:21.073 --> 00:15:24.272
someone goes to Jeju.

00:15:24.272 --> 00:15:25.994
Ah...

00:15:25.994 --> 00:15:27.228
Seeing it today,

00:15:27.228 --> 00:15:29.305
you could totally

00:15:29.305 --> 00:15:31.040
throw a party on your rooftop.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.900
What are you talking about?

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:42.143
I feel like I'm the loneliest person
in the world.

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:07.672
When I'm alone, I'm lonely because I'm alone.

00:16:07.672 --> 00:16:11.239
When I'm with someone, I'm lonely
because I'm afraid of ending up alone.

00:16:11.239 --> 00:16:13.027
Poor or rich,

00:16:13.027 --> 00:16:15.142
it's lonely either way.

00:16:17.806 --> 00:16:20.714
What's more equal than loneliness?

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.006
No.

00:16:25.006 --> 00:16:26.454
It's unfair.

00:16:26.454 --> 00:16:30.491
I'm lonelier
than anyone else, even just a little.

00:16:34.505 --> 00:16:36.797
No one understands me.

00:16:41.302 --> 00:16:43.805
I'm heading out early.

00:16:43.805 --> 00:16:46.186
Where are you going?

00:16:46.186 --> 00:16:47.977
- Sorry?
- It's only day one for her.

00:16:47.977 --> 00:16:50.078
Of course, she's going on a date.

00:16:50.078 --> 00:16:52.414
- Shh, it's a secret.
- Oh, right. A secret.

00:16:52.414 --> 00:16:54.248
Good luck.

00:17:00.688 --> 00:17:03.505
- Couldn't even keep it for a day?
- You got this.

00:17:03.505 --> 00:17:06.929
Don't start quietly and let it fizzle out.

00:17:06.929 --> 00:17:10.297
This time, even out of embarrassment,
do it right.

00:17:11.375 --> 00:17:12.500
- Auntie.
- That's right.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.902
- Auntie.
- Auntie.

00:17:14.902 --> 00:17:16.372
Auntie.

00:17:16.372 --> 00:17:18.519
Make sure you bring your boyfriend.

00:17:18.519 --> 00:17:21.238
Make sure you bring your boyfriend.

00:17:21.238 --> 00:17:24.012
Make sure you bring your boyfriend.

00:17:24.012 --> 00:17:27.783
Your relationship isn't just yours anymore.

00:17:27.783 --> 00:17:30.304
Take some responsibility. Okay?

00:17:38.472 --> 00:17:40.216
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:17:40.216 --> 00:17:43.302
What brings you here? No call or anything.

00:17:43.302 --> 00:17:46.516
- It's broad daylight. Can't I just drop by?
- Dad's not home.

00:17:46.516 --> 00:17:48.536
He's traveling.

00:17:48.536 --> 00:17:49.516
I know.

00:17:49.516 --> 00:17:51.038
Move.

00:17:59.181 --> 00:18:01.048
Did you eat?

00:18:21.659 --> 00:18:25.608
Is this what you call grieving in your own way?

00:18:25.608 --> 00:18:28.208
- It's just...
- Don't say it.

00:18:28.776 --> 00:18:31.178
I know what you're about to say

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.050
is probably right.

00:18:40.055 --> 00:18:42.022
Thanks.

00:18:44.125 --> 00:18:45.993
Let's just eat.

00:19:09.918 --> 00:19:12.625
You got a text.

00:19:12.625 --> 00:19:14.288
What is it?

00:19:18.661 --> 00:19:20.761
From the guy next door.

00:19:25.733 --> 00:19:28.736
"Jun Kyung, today's our day one."

00:19:28.736 --> 00:19:32.940
"Especially during the day." That's all I see.

00:19:39.847 --> 00:19:41.439
Here it is.

00:19:41.439 --> 00:19:44.240
Congrats on day one.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.371
Dad really knows how to make soup.
It's rich and hearty.

00:20:02.371 --> 00:20:03.638
He's pretty old-school.

00:20:03.638 --> 00:20:05.639
He must've cooked it with real care, no tricks.

00:20:05.639 --> 00:20:07.307
Yeah.

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:13.906
You know,

00:20:13.906 --> 00:20:17.684
that message from earlier...

00:20:18.811 --> 00:20:20.171
it's not really a big...

00:20:20.171 --> 00:20:22.156
- Don't say it.
- Huh?

00:20:22.839 --> 00:20:24.825
I know what you're about to say

00:20:26.186 --> 00:20:28.562
is probably right.

00:20:31.939 --> 00:20:33.835
Let's just eat.

00:20:33.835 --> 00:20:36.603
Uh, thanks.

00:20:46.749 --> 00:20:48.939
Ugh, talk about bad timing.

00:20:48.939 --> 00:20:50.851
That's embarrassing.

00:20:59.238 --> 00:21:01.228
Yes, Do Hyun.

00:21:16.278 --> 00:21:18.345
This is nice.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.505
What kind of work are you doing here?

00:21:22.505 --> 00:21:24.018
Oh, here?

00:21:24.018 --> 00:21:25.572
You're

00:21:25.572 --> 00:21:27.806
curious

00:21:27.806 --> 00:21:29.556
what I'm working on?

00:21:39.305 --> 00:21:41.272
What?

00:21:41.272 --> 00:21:42.770
It's...

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:43.913
Yeah.

00:21:43.913 --> 00:21:45.639
That coffee commercial.

00:21:46.575 --> 00:21:49.309
It's the follow-up, coming out next week.

00:21:52.513 --> 00:21:55.349
I'm putting my rough music

00:21:55.349 --> 00:21:58.785
over a beautifully made video.

00:22:03.324 --> 00:22:07.327
It's my first time
inviting someone to my studio.

00:22:08.329 --> 00:22:10.138
As you get to know me more,

00:22:10.138 --> 00:22:12.299
you won't be disappointed, right?

00:22:13.587 --> 00:22:15.702
So far, not yet.

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:26.046
How do those two look to you?

00:22:29.884 --> 00:22:31.606
They look lonely.

00:22:31.606 --> 00:22:33.253
Well...

00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:36.690
I can turn those two

00:22:37.205 --> 00:22:39.205
into a sad couple

00:22:39.205 --> 00:22:42.997
who sense a breakup coming,

00:22:42.997 --> 00:22:45.065
or into a couple

00:22:46.305 --> 00:22:47.939
just getting started,

00:22:47.939 --> 00:22:51.071
full of butterflies.

00:22:51.607 --> 00:22:53.497
How?

00:22:53.497 --> 00:22:56.009
I have that kind of power.

00:22:56.009 --> 00:22:58.079
Seriously?

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:12.060
It really changes the vibe.

00:23:20.101 --> 00:23:22.836
So those two,

00:23:23.572 --> 00:23:25.906
what happens to them now?

00:23:47.172 --> 00:23:48.996
But,

00:23:49.878 --> 00:23:51.632
we did agree

00:23:52.933 --> 00:23:56.003
to take things slow, right?

00:23:59.806 --> 00:24:01.475
Right.

00:24:21.297 --> 00:24:23.597
Did you sleep well?

00:24:24.685 --> 00:24:26.702
Yes.

00:24:26.702 --> 00:24:28.370
Yes.

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:31.505
Are you going to be a hermit again today?

00:24:31.505 --> 00:24:33.674
With the weather this nice?

00:24:41.849 --> 00:24:44.637
- No way!
- I love it!

00:24:46.454 --> 00:24:49.291
Not much longer now. Hang in there.

00:24:49.291 --> 00:24:50.924
Are you okay?

00:24:52.739 --> 00:24:54.594
You okay?

00:24:58.667 --> 00:25:00.534
You go on ahead.

00:25:13.148 --> 00:25:15.205
Why?

00:25:15.205 --> 00:25:18.305
- Why, what's wrong?
- My pants tore.

00:25:18.305 --> 00:25:19.906
Oh...

00:25:26.127 --> 00:25:28.762
Give that to me. I'll take care of it.

00:25:32.006 --> 00:25:34.000
Oh, no.

00:25:36.071 --> 00:25:38.305
Thank you.

00:25:47.982 --> 00:25:50.039
Guess that functional jacket

00:25:50.039 --> 00:25:52.686
really did its job.

00:25:52.686 --> 00:25:54.439
That was close.

00:25:54.439 --> 00:25:56.323
Thanks to you, really.

00:26:01.996 --> 00:26:04.798
- Don't sit there! That stings!
- It stings!

00:26:08.969 --> 00:26:10.638
That's just cruel.

00:26:10.638 --> 00:26:12.948
The more I think about it, that landlord,

00:26:12.948 --> 00:26:16.069
how can they just change the move-out date
whenever they feel like it?

00:26:16.069 --> 00:26:18.808
If that's the situation, what can I do?

00:26:18.808 --> 00:26:20.681
I should be understanding.

00:26:20.681 --> 00:26:23.809
They even covered
storage for the furniture and big items.

00:26:23.809 --> 00:26:25.920
There isn't much left.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.370
So that's it.

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:28.390
All done.

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:30.205
Don't bother

00:26:30.205 --> 00:26:31.926
coming back up later.

00:26:31.926 --> 00:26:33.527
It'll go faster if we do it together.

00:26:33.527 --> 00:26:36.150
A junior's coming soon,
so I'll finish the rest with them.

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:37.706
So,

00:26:37.706 --> 00:26:40.836
could you grab us something cold to drink?

00:26:40.836 --> 00:26:42.739
What should I get?

00:26:42.739 --> 00:26:44.471
Whatever.

00:26:45.439 --> 00:26:48.108
- Watch the traffic.
- Got it.

00:26:51.378 --> 00:26:54.348
He says the move date suddenly changed,
so he'll stay at a junior's place.

00:26:54.348 --> 00:26:56.028
Wouldn't that be awkward?

00:26:56.028 --> 00:26:57.188
For who?

00:26:57.188 --> 00:26:58.454
Him?

00:26:58.454 --> 00:27:00.353
Or your feelings?

00:27:01.655 --> 00:27:03.749
Hearing he's leaving suddenly
just makes me uneasy.

00:27:03.749 --> 00:27:04.949
What, is he emigrating?

00:27:04.949 --> 00:27:07.228
Getting deployed somewhere?

00:27:07.228 --> 00:27:08.449
Should I tell him to stay at my place?

00:27:08.449 --> 00:27:10.080
Are you out of your mind?

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.833
You've only known him for a few days,
and you're talking about cohabiting?

00:27:12.833 --> 00:27:14.735
It's not cohabiting.

00:27:14.735 --> 00:27:17.171
It's just temporary until he moves.

00:27:17.171 --> 00:27:19.773
That's too much.
You two haven't slept together yet.

00:27:26.013 --> 00:27:27.430
What?

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:29.149
Did you sleep with him?

00:27:33.718 --> 00:27:35.222
Even so,

00:27:35.222 --> 00:27:38.158
do you really need

00:27:38.158 --> 00:27:41.351
to share everything at the very start?

00:27:41.351 --> 00:27:42.111
Is that so?

00:27:42.111 --> 00:27:44.832
Weren't you taking things slow?

00:27:44.832 --> 00:27:48.302
His bathroom habits, his snoring decibels,

00:27:48.302 --> 00:27:50.704
your bare face, your farting.

00:27:50.704 --> 00:27:52.473
There's nowhere to hide.

00:27:52.473 --> 00:27:56.010
You should be showing
only the lovely sides at this stage.

00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:58.712
You're playing a brinkmanship tactic.

00:27:58.712 --> 00:28:00.380
Right?

00:28:05.152 --> 00:28:06.503
Looks like his junior's here.

00:28:06.503 --> 00:28:08.288
You can get off.

00:28:13.794 --> 00:28:15.864
What's going on?

00:28:15.864 --> 00:28:17.463
Why?

00:28:18.901 --> 00:28:20.367
That junior turned out to be a woman.

00:28:20.367 --> 00:28:21.405
What?

00:28:21.405 --> 00:28:23.637
Her hair's longer than mine,

00:28:24.972 --> 00:28:27.206
and she looks slimmer too.

00:28:28.672 --> 00:28:32.612
The junior he's crashing with is a woman?

00:28:33.315 --> 00:28:36.352
As expected, he's a free spirit
in full storm mode.

00:28:36.352 --> 00:28:38.018
Hang up.

00:28:47.928 --> 00:28:49.363
Looks like your junior's here.

00:28:49.363 --> 00:28:50.532
Yeah.

00:28:50.532 --> 00:28:53.033
Just went back up for the last box.

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:56.003
You must be really close.

00:28:56.003 --> 00:28:57.680
My closest junior.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.506
We've seen it all,

00:29:00.307 --> 00:29:01.442
good and bad.

00:29:01.442 --> 00:29:03.055
Do Hyun.

00:29:03.944 --> 00:29:05.537
Yes.

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:08.248
So...

00:29:08.822 --> 00:29:09.817
Well...

00:29:09.817 --> 00:29:12.073
Here's your coffee.

00:29:12.073 --> 00:29:13.821
Thank you.

00:29:13.821 --> 00:29:15.421
Wait.

00:29:22.147 --> 00:29:24.197
Want to stay at my place?

00:29:26.829 --> 00:29:28.535
Uh...

00:29:28.535 --> 00:29:30.135
Well...

00:29:31.747 --> 00:29:33.607
So...

00:29:33.607 --> 00:29:35.872
It's close for moving,

00:29:35.872 --> 00:29:37.945
the place is spacious,

00:29:37.945 --> 00:29:39.548
and, um...

00:29:39.548 --> 00:29:41.682
your studio's nearby too.

00:29:41.682 --> 00:29:43.187
Okay.

00:29:43.187 --> 00:29:44.797
I will.

00:29:46.655 --> 00:29:48.388
Really?

00:29:52.405 --> 00:29:54.496
He's my junior.

00:29:54.496 --> 00:29:56.296
Woo Jung Hoon.

00:30:03.927 --> 00:30:04.938
Say hi.

00:30:04.938 --> 00:30:06.742
This is Seo Jun Kyung.

00:30:06.742 --> 00:30:08.142
My girlfriend.

00:30:08.142 --> 00:30:10.012
Oh,

00:30:10.012 --> 00:30:12.012
nice to meet you.

00:30:16.572 --> 00:30:18.385
So,

00:30:18.385 --> 00:30:20.205
you thought

00:30:20.205 --> 00:30:23.056
my junior was a woman?

00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:31.700
What kind of image do I have?

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:35.835
I'm not that Hollywood.

00:30:36.939 --> 00:30:38.238
It's just...

00:30:38.238 --> 00:30:41.408
No, I mean... his hair looks so silky,

00:30:41.408 --> 00:30:44.944
and his legs are so slim.

00:30:47.706 --> 00:30:50.306
I should treat him to a meal sometime.

00:30:50.306 --> 00:30:52.778
We should eat too.

00:30:53.845 --> 00:30:55.806
Since it's moving day,

00:30:55.806 --> 00:30:58.025
do we have a Chinese place number or something?

00:30:58.025 --> 00:30:59.859
Oh my.

00:31:03.672 --> 00:31:05.598
Thank you.

00:31:07.002 --> 00:31:08.902
For being jealous.

00:31:13.373 --> 00:31:15.608
Hold on a second.

00:31:17.845 --> 00:31:19.446
Hello?

00:31:21.784 --> 00:31:23.686
Oh, I see.

00:31:23.686 --> 00:31:25.785
How close together are the contractions?

00:31:27.588 --> 00:31:29.930
Then, we won't need oxytocin.

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:31.624
I'll head over now.

00:31:34.863 --> 00:31:36.450
Hey, Sol.

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:38.350
You said four people, right?

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:39.910
Five?

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:42.604
That's fine. Totally fine.

00:31:42.604 --> 00:31:44.505
I've already taken care of everything,

00:31:44.505 --> 00:31:46.773
so just show up.

00:31:58.138 --> 00:31:59.819
Okay.

00:32:42.496 --> 00:32:44.831
Did you fix your pants?

00:32:46.967 --> 00:32:48.237
You didn't know, did you?

00:32:48.237 --> 00:32:50.170
I'm staying next door.

00:32:54.276 --> 00:32:56.609
Just a second.

00:33:01.798 --> 00:33:04.073
Here it is.

00:33:04.073 --> 00:33:05.919
Thank you so much.

00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:10.772
The wind in Jeju

00:33:10.772 --> 00:33:13.092
is no joke.

00:33:14.161 --> 00:33:16.261
Yeah, the pants are fixed.

00:33:16.261 --> 00:33:20.166
Luckily, someone at the lobby had a sewing kit.

00:33:21.034 --> 00:33:22.721
You must be very handy.

00:33:22.721 --> 00:33:24.111
Not really.

00:33:24.111 --> 00:33:26.041
I just made sure

00:33:26.041 --> 00:33:28.208
it looks decent, so it doesn't show.

00:33:32.546 --> 00:33:35.148
What are you doing for dinner?

00:33:36.828 --> 00:33:38.482
I'm just going to grab
something quick in my room.

00:33:38.482 --> 00:33:41.515
Don't rush a meal. Every meal matters.

00:33:41.515 --> 00:33:44.076
Try the Italian place in the Ocean Wing.

00:33:44.076 --> 00:33:46.059
It's pretty solid.

00:33:48.629 --> 00:33:51.755
Want to grab dinner together?

00:33:51.755 --> 00:33:55.201
I'm alone during free time too.

00:34:29.171 --> 00:34:31.404
I guess I'm just not great at this.

00:35:02.465 --> 00:35:03.973
I saw you booked

00:35:03.973 --> 00:35:07.040
the yacht tour for tomorrow.

00:35:08.444 --> 00:35:10.045
Yes.

00:35:14.481 --> 00:35:17.583
I signed up because my wife would've loved it.

00:35:19.305 --> 00:35:20.953
But recently,

00:35:22.622 --> 00:35:24.991
she passed away.

00:35:25.739 --> 00:35:27.335
Oh...

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:30.596
I wished we could've come together,

00:35:31.105 --> 00:35:33.166
but it's too late now.

00:35:35.945 --> 00:35:37.804
You still came.

00:35:41.511 --> 00:35:43.643
That matters.

00:35:48.915 --> 00:35:51.085
- Happy birthday to you.
- Happy birthday to you.

00:35:51.085 --> 00:35:53.186
- Happy birthday to you.
- Happy birthday to you.

00:35:53.186 --> 00:35:57.990
- Happy birthday to my dear Sol.
- Happy birthday to my dear Sol.

00:36:02.939 --> 00:36:06.232
No, please. Don't do that.

00:36:23.205 --> 00:36:25.017
Just a moment.

00:36:27.405 --> 00:36:29.288
Just a moment.

00:36:42.905 --> 00:36:43.938
What are you doing?

00:36:43.938 --> 00:36:46.640
Please go outside.

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.274
It's okay. Let's step out.

00:36:50.039 --> 00:36:51.911
They won't allow it.

00:36:52.939 --> 00:36:54.606
You can't smoke in here.

00:36:54.606 --> 00:36:56.382
You have to go outside.

00:37:01.105 --> 00:37:03.973
What's going on?

00:37:03.973 --> 00:37:05.691
Just let it all out.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.172
Thank you

00:37:29.172 --> 00:37:31.384
so much for today.

00:37:35.731 --> 00:37:37.329
Well...

00:37:39.006 --> 00:37:41.894
you didn't come here
with bad intentions, right?

00:37:42.398 --> 00:37:44.166
Sorry?

00:37:44.166 --> 00:37:46.199
That would be very troubling.

00:37:49.603 --> 00:37:52.572
I'm a person of faith.

00:37:53.409 --> 00:37:54.539
Then

00:37:54.539 --> 00:37:56.609
I suppose there's nothing to worry about.

00:37:59.112 --> 00:38:01.858
But has anything like that happened here?

00:38:01.858 --> 00:38:02.749
Pardon?

00:38:02.749 --> 00:38:04.707
I mean people who come here to end it all.

00:38:05.619 --> 00:38:07.656
Yes, there was a case quite a while back.

00:38:07.656 --> 00:38:09.956
On the Camino de Santiago.

00:38:11.358 --> 00:38:13.358
I really enjoyed today.

00:38:13.358 --> 00:38:15.561
Same here.

00:38:38.347 --> 00:38:40.286
Call me when you wrap up.

00:38:51.505 --> 00:38:52.872
It's me.

00:38:52.872 --> 00:38:54.935
I'm all done now.

00:38:54.935 --> 00:38:56.569
That took ages.

00:38:56.569 --> 00:38:58.805
That kid really owes his mom everything.

00:38:58.805 --> 00:39:01.706
Labor was brutal.

00:39:01.706 --> 00:39:05.006
I'm wiped out and starving too.

00:39:05.006 --> 00:39:05.979
Get here soon.

00:39:05.979 --> 00:39:08.272
I didn't eat,

00:39:08.272 --> 00:39:09.741
waiting to eat with you.

00:39:09.741 --> 00:39:11.520
Still?

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:13.619
You should've gone ahead.

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:17.857
Oh right. There's nothing to eat at home.

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:21.697
How about those noodles
we missed out on earlier?

00:39:21.697 --> 00:39:22.965
Sounds good.

00:39:22.965 --> 00:39:24.380
Hurry over.

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:25.967
Okay.

[The Man Next Door]

[Do Hyun]

00:40:24.811 --> 00:40:28.361
Darn it... I'm beyond saving.

00:40:53.073 --> 00:40:54.754
Thank you.

00:40:59.893 --> 00:41:02.395
Go ahead. I'll be fine.

[Please let this work]

00:41:16.712 --> 00:41:19.612
Being alone is survivable.

00:41:20.947 --> 00:41:23.272
But even then,

00:41:23.272 --> 00:41:26.272
you still need someone who'll tell you

00:41:26.272 --> 00:41:28.754
it's okay to be alone.

00:41:30.893 --> 00:41:34.006
Honore de Balzac.

00:41:34.006 --> 00:41:34.928
Sorry about that.

00:41:34.928 --> 00:41:37.897
How's your night going?

00:41:37.897 --> 00:41:40.772
If you're feeling lonely right now,

00:41:40.772 --> 00:41:41.968
I can say it for you.

00:41:41.968 --> 00:41:43.672
That'll be 9,000 won.

00:41:43.672 --> 00:41:47.606
That being alone is still okay.

00:41:55.105 --> 00:41:56.882
You're back?

00:42:00.055 --> 00:42:01.854
Hungry, right?

00:42:09.138 --> 00:42:12.072
I called maintenance for the washer.

00:42:12.072 --> 00:42:13.966
Turns out it was broken.

00:42:16.047 --> 00:42:18.237
It was new.

00:42:19.038 --> 00:42:22.041
My place, usually pitch-black,

00:42:24.739 --> 00:42:26.980
finally felt

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:29.551
like it was glad

00:42:29.551 --> 00:42:31.350
What are you doing?

00:42:32.498 --> 00:42:35.855
- to see me.
- Nice! Good call.

00:42:37.157 --> 00:42:39.291
Go wash up.

00:42:56.645 --> 00:42:58.011
How is it?

00:42:58.011 --> 00:42:59.712
It's delicious.

00:43:02.251 --> 00:43:04.281
Only "delicious"?

00:43:05.054 --> 00:43:07.045
Nothing else with it?

00:43:07.045 --> 00:43:08.888
Like what?

00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:12.258
Well...

00:43:12.258 --> 00:43:14.059
Nothing that hits the heart?

00:43:15.564 --> 00:43:17.530
Are you asking for praise?

00:43:21.601 --> 00:43:23.836
Most dishes, sure,

00:43:24.404 --> 00:43:25.806
but curry's different.

00:43:25.806 --> 00:43:27.876
It should be mostly comfortable.

00:43:27.876 --> 00:43:29.475
Why's that?

00:43:31.211 --> 00:43:33.479
Curry's my comfort food.

00:43:34.237 --> 00:43:37.505
Back when I was broke,
freezing, and scraping by as a musician,

00:43:37.505 --> 00:43:40.352
I'd grab a 1,000-won curry powder packet,

00:43:41.223 --> 00:43:43.073
throw in just potatoes

00:43:43.073 --> 00:43:47.427
and onions, make a big batch,

00:43:47.427 --> 00:43:48.672
and day two,

00:43:48.672 --> 00:43:50.006
day three,

00:43:50.006 --> 00:43:51.772
it tasted deeper,

00:43:51.772 --> 00:43:54.667
and somehow even better.

00:43:58.238 --> 00:44:00.172
Like it levels up overnight.

00:44:02.542 --> 00:44:04.978
I formed this tiny fantasy.

00:44:04.978 --> 00:44:06.246
What kind?

00:44:06.246 --> 00:44:07.880
One night,

00:44:09.105 --> 00:44:10.916
I come home wiped out

00:44:11.472 --> 00:44:14.353
for no good reason,

00:44:16.222 --> 00:44:18.724
and there she is, apron on,

00:44:19.872 --> 00:44:21.760
stirring curry,

00:44:22.595 --> 00:44:24.105
that smell taking over

00:44:24.105 --> 00:44:26.832
the entire apartment.

00:44:31.315 --> 00:44:33.106
Well...

00:44:33.106 --> 00:44:35.007
That's a pretty simple wish.

00:44:35.708 --> 00:44:37.910
But there's a catch.

00:44:39.379 --> 00:44:41.172
The wife

00:44:41.172 --> 00:44:44.350
has to have the apron on and nothing else.

00:44:46.085 --> 00:44:47.816
- Ugh, you perv.
- You'll actually do it, right?

00:44:47.816 --> 00:44:49.758
- Me?
- Yeah.

00:44:49.758 --> 00:44:52.124
You're out of your mind.

00:44:53.159 --> 00:44:55.639
Please make my wish come true.

00:44:55.639 --> 00:44:57.096
That's ridiculous.

00:45:06.539 --> 00:45:09.642
I've never seen you laugh this easily.

00:45:12.478 --> 00:45:14.614
You tagged along so I wouldn't hole up

00:45:14.614 --> 00:45:16.282
in my room acting all tough, right?

00:45:16.282 --> 00:45:18.418
Man, guiding must be such a grind.

00:45:18.418 --> 00:45:20.486
Not at all.

00:45:20.486 --> 00:45:22.255
I get to travel for free, as much as I want,

00:45:22.255 --> 00:45:24.791
and they pay me too. It's honestly the best.

00:45:24.791 --> 00:45:27.660
And the yacht ride is the most expensive add-on
in the whole package.

00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:29.528
Oh, really?

00:45:38.538 --> 00:45:41.273
Being somewhere this nice
makes me think of my husband.

00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:45.531
We never got around to a yacht trip together.

00:45:45.531 --> 00:45:47.130
You still can.

00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:49.581
There will be another chance.

00:45:50.616 --> 00:45:53.919
I lost mine too. Ten years ago.

00:46:08.201 --> 00:46:10.239
This tastes nothing like

00:46:10.239 --> 00:46:12.274
what I used to eat in Seoul.

00:46:12.274 --> 00:46:14.104
Try the turban shell too.

00:46:14.104 --> 00:46:17.305
The haenyeo ladies pulled it
from the water right here.

00:46:33.095 --> 00:46:35.194
"Too salty."

00:46:35.931 --> 00:46:37.896
"Too spicy."

00:46:39.201 --> 00:46:41.800
My wife used to get on me
about that all the time.

00:46:43.774 --> 00:46:46.839
And now the one who only ate clean
isn't here anymore.

00:46:48.034 --> 00:46:50.242
Funny how that works.

00:47:06.814 --> 00:47:08.764
Hey, look over there.

00:47:08.764 --> 00:47:11.722
See that group?

00:47:11.722 --> 00:47:13.002
Yeah.

00:47:13.002 --> 00:47:15.000
Keep this quiet, okay?

00:47:15.638 --> 00:47:19.155
Their deal is a little different.

00:47:19.155 --> 00:47:21.006
Different how?

00:47:22.115 --> 00:47:24.555
It's the "Erase-It" package.

00:47:24.555 --> 00:47:26.478
- Erase it?
- Shh.

00:47:29.816 --> 00:47:32.988
They look cheerful,

00:47:32.988 --> 00:47:37.322
but they're going through it.

00:47:39.992 --> 00:47:42.028
They picked this

00:47:42.028 --> 00:47:44.831
just to block it out for a bit.

00:47:44.831 --> 00:47:46.566
When they head home,

00:47:46.566 --> 00:47:50.169
real life's still waiting, exactly the same.

00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:53.606
But while they're here,
they want a break from all of it.

00:47:53.606 --> 00:47:55.739
So that's why

00:47:55.739 --> 00:47:57.243
they're all in the same hats.

00:47:57.243 --> 00:47:59.138
- Exactly.
- Got it.

00:47:59.138 --> 00:48:00.706
Look.

00:48:00.706 --> 00:48:02.006
See that pair

00:48:02.006 --> 00:48:03.539
in the denim shirts?

00:48:03.539 --> 00:48:04.317
Right there?

00:48:04.317 --> 00:48:06.352
- Taking pictures.
- Yeah.

00:48:06.352 --> 00:48:08.821
Five years married.

00:48:08.821 --> 00:48:10.826
Both have day jobs.

00:48:10.826 --> 00:48:12.138
He learned

00:48:12.138 --> 00:48:16.229
she'd been seeing a coworker.

00:48:16.229 --> 00:48:20.233
They blow up at each other pretty much daily.

00:48:20.233 --> 00:48:23.135
And nothing's resolved.

00:48:27.843 --> 00:48:29.044
See?

00:48:29.044 --> 00:48:31.443
They're switched to
"shut-it-off" mode right now.

00:48:33.006 --> 00:48:34.913
I see.

00:48:36.415 --> 00:48:38.272
And beside them,

00:48:38.272 --> 00:48:40.887
that husband backed someone,

00:48:40.887 --> 00:48:44.257
got wiped out, and now he's in the hole.

00:48:44.257 --> 00:48:46.485
The house is gone too.

00:48:46.485 --> 00:48:49.270
What can he even do?

00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:51.734
- That's so upsetting.
- Seriously.

00:48:51.734 --> 00:48:53.632
It really is.

00:48:55.902 --> 00:48:58.872
So the people over there

00:48:58.872 --> 00:49:01.306
have stories like that too?

00:49:01.844 --> 00:49:03.609
Exactly.

00:49:07.396 --> 00:49:08.514
Try it once.

00:49:08.514 --> 00:49:10.486
Huh? Try what?

00:49:10.486 --> 00:49:12.651
Try it.

00:49:15.639 --> 00:49:17.305
Ah...

00:49:17.305 --> 00:49:19.024
come on...

00:49:19.539 --> 00:49:21.360
No...

00:49:23.596 --> 00:49:25.316
I can't do this.

00:49:25.316 --> 00:49:27.799
Just say something.

00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:30.135
Anything works.

00:49:32.838 --> 00:49:34.673
That guy's

00:49:35.672 --> 00:49:38.039
a civil servant, desk job.

00:49:38.039 --> 00:49:39.830
Yeah.

00:49:39.830 --> 00:49:41.472
Recently, he started

00:49:41.472 --> 00:49:44.070
thinking about retiring

00:49:44.070 --> 00:49:46.919
a little early.

00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:50.222
And then he just pulled the plug and resigned.

00:49:50.222 --> 00:49:54.960
He wanted more time with his wife.

00:49:57.263 --> 00:49:59.264
But his wife

00:50:00.472 --> 00:50:02.634
got in a bad accident

00:50:04.937 --> 00:50:07.210
and lost an arm.

00:50:07.210 --> 00:50:08.299
Oh no.

00:50:08.299 --> 00:50:10.309
That's so cruel.

00:50:15.448 --> 00:50:17.482
After the accident,

00:50:19.238 --> 00:50:21.687
she stopped smiling.

00:50:26.292 --> 00:50:28.260
I think she's convinced

00:50:29.795 --> 00:50:32.564
there's no hope left.

00:50:36.504 --> 00:50:38.303
He's been

00:50:39.439 --> 00:50:41.405
giving up

00:50:41.405 --> 00:50:43.642
his time, his heart...

00:50:44.278 --> 00:50:46.812
everything for her.

00:50:48.639 --> 00:50:51.216
But he's exhausted.

00:50:53.619 --> 00:50:56.488
Sometimes he thinks,

00:50:57.078 --> 00:50:59.725
"When will this end?"

00:51:02.445 --> 00:51:06.164
Then he hates himself for even thinking that.

00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:11.472
And the reason he traveled alone is...

00:51:11.472 --> 00:51:13.171
Well...

00:51:21.554 --> 00:51:23.182
Her arm looks fine.

00:51:23.182 --> 00:51:24.779
Sorry?

00:51:28.821 --> 00:51:32.424
No one knows she wears a prosthetic arm.

00:51:33.325 --> 00:51:34.992
Her arm itches.

00:51:34.992 --> 00:51:38.730
It's like she forgets it's even prosthetic.

00:51:41.397 --> 00:51:43.405
Did you write this just so I'd read it?

00:51:43.405 --> 00:51:44.704
Huh?

00:51:44.704 --> 00:51:46.705
Can you even hear how this sounds?

00:51:48.611 --> 00:51:50.776
I mean...

00:51:50.776 --> 00:51:52.839
We're past the age of stupidity.

00:51:52.839 --> 00:51:54.513
If you'd used your phone,

00:51:54.513 --> 00:51:56.582
or put in even the tiniest bit of effort,

00:51:56.582 --> 00:52:00.052
you wouldn't have
turned in something like this.

00:52:01.439 --> 00:52:02.788
You know...

00:52:02.788 --> 00:52:05.124
When everyone else got jobs after undergrad,

00:52:05.124 --> 00:52:08.561
you came to grad school acting
like you had some grand academic calling.

00:52:08.561 --> 00:52:10.706
Honestly, I don't care.

00:52:10.706 --> 00:52:12.110
Yeah?

00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:16.001
Do you even care about your own life
and where you're headed?

00:52:18.494 --> 00:52:21.306
If you did, you wouldn't be doing this.

00:52:21.850 --> 00:52:25.344
But your poor parents must care a lot.

00:52:28.214 --> 00:52:29.219
Geez...

00:52:29.219 --> 00:52:32.784
Clueless that you're ruining your own life.

00:52:33.355 --> 00:52:35.887
You poor thing.

00:52:43.372 --> 00:52:45.240
That bastard.

00:52:45.731 --> 00:52:47.549
Dragging my parents into it now?

00:52:47.549 --> 00:52:50.436
Like he's so great.

00:52:50.436 --> 00:52:52.037
Why not say it to his face?

00:52:52.037 --> 00:52:55.130
This is straight-up disrespect.
Professor power trip stuff.

00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:56.439
So what?

00:52:56.439 --> 00:52:58.276
You're going to sue him?

00:53:01.483 --> 00:53:03.088
No.

00:53:03.719 --> 00:53:06.318
I'll rewrite it and resubmit.

00:53:07.089 --> 00:53:08.754
Fine.

00:53:13.325 --> 00:53:15.928
When do I get to meet your boyfriend?

00:53:15.928 --> 00:53:17.429
Why now?

00:53:17.429 --> 00:53:20.133
Shouldn't you two go public already?

00:53:20.133 --> 00:53:22.489
Like, make it official with everyone.

00:53:22.489 --> 00:53:23.849
You're basically living together now.

00:53:23.849 --> 00:53:26.405
It's not living together, I told you.

00:53:33.546 --> 00:53:34.683
Are you not going out?

00:53:34.683 --> 00:53:36.381
Pick up.

00:53:40.686 --> 00:53:42.048
Hi, Do Hyun.

00:53:42.048 --> 00:53:43.848
You're finished, right?

00:53:43.848 --> 00:53:45.462
What should we do for dinner?

00:53:45.462 --> 00:53:46.283
Dinner?

00:53:46.283 --> 00:53:48.394
Hyeong Jun says he's making dakbokkeumtang.

00:53:48.394 --> 00:53:51.330
How does that sound?

00:53:51.330 --> 00:53:53.043
- Sorry?
- No, he's...

00:53:53.043 --> 00:53:54.867
Let's eat together!

00:53:54.867 --> 00:53:57.436
- Hey.
- That sounds great.

00:53:57.436 --> 00:53:58.922
Is that okay?

00:53:58.922 --> 00:54:00.843
Please don't feel pressured to eat with them.

00:54:00.843 --> 00:54:02.607
He's not much of a cook.

00:54:03.973 --> 00:54:05.211
Lee Yeon, Ian.

00:54:05.211 --> 00:54:07.115
Come and eat.

00:54:36.041 --> 00:54:39.712
It's been ages since Jun Kyung dated anyone.

00:54:39.712 --> 00:54:42.572
Sometimes she feels like our eldest daughter,

00:54:42.572 --> 00:54:44.850
so I'm extra happy.

00:54:47.005 --> 00:54:48.787
I heard you make music.

00:54:49.271 --> 00:54:50.589
Yes.

00:54:50.589 --> 00:54:52.394
What kind of music do you do?

00:54:54.084 --> 00:54:57.929
I don't really stick to one specific genre.

00:54:59.265 --> 00:55:03.291
Then do you busk, like on the street?

00:55:04.525 --> 00:55:05.704
Well...

00:55:05.704 --> 00:55:07.746
if I had to label it,
it's more for film and video.

00:55:07.746 --> 00:55:10.908
Oh, for video.

00:55:11.443 --> 00:55:14.580
Anything we might recognize?

00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:17.315
Tell us what you've done.

00:55:19.539 --> 00:55:21.286
Something you'd know?

00:55:22.224 --> 00:55:23.322
Well...

00:55:23.322 --> 00:55:24.757
It doesn't have to be famous.

00:55:24.757 --> 00:55:27.659
Just give us anything. We'll look it up.

00:55:28.894 --> 00:55:30.562
Then...

00:55:32.272 --> 00:55:33.899
how about this?

00:55:34.472 --> 00:55:36.167
Do you know it?

00:55:46.679 --> 00:55:48.413
I know this one!

00:55:56.606 --> 00:55:58.190
This one has animals, right?

00:55:58.190 --> 00:56:01.059
They just met. How are they this close already?

00:56:03.198 --> 00:56:05.196
Look at you.

00:56:05.834 --> 00:56:07.432
What?

00:56:08.619 --> 00:56:10.806
You barely know each other.

00:56:10.806 --> 00:56:12.904
Do you like him that much?

00:56:14.209 --> 00:56:15.974
Yeah, I like him.

00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:20.606
Maybe I got my hopes up too much.

00:56:20.606 --> 00:56:23.215
He's not drop-dead gorgeous or anything.

00:56:23.215 --> 00:56:27.156
And it's not like his physique is insane.

00:56:27.156 --> 00:56:29.230
So what is it? What's the reason?

00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:32.911
Why did our worldly, ice-cold Jun Kyung

00:56:32.911 --> 00:56:35.026
fall this hard?

00:56:41.704 --> 00:56:43.769
Just because.

00:56:43.769 --> 00:56:45.006
Just because?

00:56:45.006 --> 00:56:46.138
Yeah.

00:56:46.138 --> 00:56:47.728
I just like him.

00:56:54.883 --> 00:56:55.814
Get home safe.

00:56:55.814 --> 00:56:57.116
- I'll get the door.
- I'm off now.

00:56:57.116 --> 00:56:58.414
Hyeong Jun.

00:56:58.414 --> 00:56:59.785
You remember what I said, right?

00:56:59.785 --> 00:57:01.886
Yeah, I remember.

00:57:02.458 --> 00:57:03.455
Bye, Jun Kyung.

00:57:03.455 --> 00:57:04.255
Bye.

00:57:04.255 --> 00:57:06.024
Bye, Do Hyun.

00:57:12.965 --> 00:57:14.575
So?

00:57:16.235 --> 00:57:18.340
I'm against this relationship.

00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:19.508
Why?

00:57:19.508 --> 00:57:22.240
You were hitting it off with Do Hyun.

00:57:24.247 --> 00:57:26.311
Do Hyun's too good for her.

00:57:27.082 --> 00:57:29.481
He's wasted on Jun Kyung.

00:57:29.481 --> 00:57:32.603
Honestly, I don't like it either.

00:57:32.603 --> 00:57:34.083
Why's that?

00:57:34.083 --> 00:57:35.539
Because now,

00:57:35.539 --> 00:57:38.090
whenever something fun happens,

00:57:38.090 --> 00:57:41.340
she'll tell Do Hyun first, not me.

00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:45.063
And when things go bad, she'll lean on Do Hyun.

00:57:50.167 --> 00:57:52.037
To be honest,

00:57:52.806 --> 00:57:54.773
I was scared.

00:57:55.311 --> 00:57:56.975
Of what?

00:58:00.446 --> 00:58:03.786
That I wouldn't fit in with someone like him.

00:58:03.786 --> 00:58:06.451
Or that he wouldn't want to fit in with me.

00:58:09.491 --> 00:58:11.523
Haven't I changed so much?

00:58:12.627 --> 00:58:14.426
No.

00:58:14.966 --> 00:58:17.599
You were always like that.

00:58:17.599 --> 00:58:20.565
You're just back to being Seo Jun Kyung.

00:58:24.997 --> 00:58:26.620
Really?

00:58:31.243 --> 00:58:32.846
What are you doing?

00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:35.447
You're not even changed.

00:58:39.084 --> 00:58:41.489
It's bedtime, and now I'm sobering up.

00:58:42.721 --> 00:58:46.024
I guess I got a little too excited today.

00:58:50.878 --> 00:58:54.132
I think today will stick with me for a while.

00:58:56.114 --> 00:58:58.904
It was such a good day,

00:58:58.904 --> 00:59:02.040
I almost feel like I don't deserve it.

00:59:10.439 --> 00:59:12.317
Actually...

00:59:14.539 --> 00:59:17.789
It hasn't been long since my mom passed away.

00:59:34.201 --> 00:59:35.974
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

00:59:58.405 --> 01:00:01.232
I take after my mom a lot.

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.970
But toward the end,

01:00:07.773 --> 01:00:10.241
we really grew

01:00:11.109 --> 01:00:13.077
to resent each other.

01:00:21.153 --> 01:00:23.488
I never even got to say

01:00:24.606 --> 01:00:26.524
I was sorry.

01:00:29.572 --> 01:00:31.629
We didn't make up.

01:00:34.139 --> 01:00:36.201
It just ended.

01:00:48.238 --> 01:00:50.815
Even if you never said it,

01:00:53.706 --> 01:00:56.254
just carrying

01:01:00.339 --> 01:01:03.428
that feeling,

01:01:03.428 --> 01:01:05.572
your mom

01:01:05.572 --> 01:01:07.632
would say,

01:01:11.339 --> 01:01:13.571
"It's okay."

01:01:36.697 --> 01:01:40.832
What day do you remember most?

01:01:41.372 --> 01:01:44.102
- What?
- Except the day we met.

01:01:57.739 --> 01:02:00.184
Well...

01:02:03.898 --> 01:02:06.758
The day I remember most...

01:02:14.205 --> 01:02:16.968
is the day my son was born.
