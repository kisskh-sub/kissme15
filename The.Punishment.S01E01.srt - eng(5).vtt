00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:25.350
Haven't we lost enough
in the stock market already?

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:27.400
Stop dreaming
about getting rich overnight.

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:28.530
It's not realistic.

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:30.400
We can't rent the land to them.

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:31.750
But we still need to make money.

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:33.270
Once Hanzhou Port is completed,

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:35.200
logistics
will be the most profitable business.

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.030
If you ask me,

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:37.270
we should do it ourselves.

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:38.590
We have so many young people here.

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:40.450
Why can't we buy a truck ourselves

00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:41.790
and start our own logistics business?

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:43.030
Come on, Tianye.

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:45.030
Do you even have the money needed for it?

00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:46.290
This isn't Monopoly.

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:47.830
That's right, Tianye.

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:49.440
Have you ever worked in logistics?

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.920
We've never done it before.

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:52.720
First time, right? No experience.

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:53.510
Right?

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:54.950
Besides,

00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:56.400
they're

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:57.790
a big group.

00:33:57.790 --> 00:33:59.160
They want to do logistics now,

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.490
and we also want to do it.

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:01.920
Isn't that a clash?

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:02.510
No, Uncle Limin.

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:03.270
We can't...

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.310
No, we can't keep backing down.

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:06.970
Longwan always compromises.

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:08.280
We can't go on like this.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.510
This piece of cake belongs to Longwan.

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:11.070
Whoever tries to take it from us—
we fight them.

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:11.760
You just talked about fighting.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:12.960
All young people know is fighting.

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:13.510
Tianye.

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:14.719
They fight every day.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.190
In the ancestral hall,

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:19.070
don't talk about fighting or killing.

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:19.870
That's right.

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.820
I heard everything you all just said.

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.070
My opinion is

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.420
we won't rent Longwan to them.

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:30.110
No matter how much money they offer,

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:31.610
I won't sign the contract.

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:35.480
If the ancestral hall is gone,
our roots are gone.

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.360
So no matter how much they offer,

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.989
I can't sign the contract.

00:34:40.989 --> 00:34:43.050
Let's end the discussion here today.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.030
Today is the ancestral worship ceremony.

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:46.880
Everyone, go make preparations.

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:47.590
Let's go.

Let's go.

Let's go.

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:50.840
We can't rent it to them.

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.110
Never.

are all because of our ancestors!

with their blood and sweat!

this is Longwan's ancestral hall,

is indeed a cultural attraction.

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:37.630
However,

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:38.800
it's somewhat

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:39.730
outdated.

Why come at this time?

00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:44.500
