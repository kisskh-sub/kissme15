Wijit Mawan is the Mae Sue
assigned to Sunday.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.616
Last time, the Sunday ritual was disrupted.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.976
This could be the next victim.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.160
Someone sent a Tukkata Sia-Kaban
hidden inside a figure to Darin.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.896
So you came to check this place

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.240
because a ghost told Thup?

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.160
I need to know how it chooses its victims.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.696
Should we go to the origin point?

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.680
We might find where the killer came from.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.400
And maybe read his thinking.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.440
Even though it's been dead for
a long time, the spirit is still restless.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.336
He extended his own fate the wrong way.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.640
By using other people's lives to do it.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.400
That's why he can't be reborn.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.720
Let's go in.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.680
You'll be okay, right?

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.800
I'll be fine.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.520
I've got you here.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.720
That means I'm safe.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.400
Thup.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.080
Thup.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.200
Could you wait outside for me for a bit?

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.400
I'm not leaving you alone.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.720
I'll be fine.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.440
Please trust me.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.320
If anything happens, call me.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.800
You've got some nerve coming in here.

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:40.720
Once you step in, you die.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.400
Thup.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.720
Thup.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.960
Thup, what happened?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.720
P'Singha, don't come in.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.000
I'm fine.

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.760
But if you come in, everything
we worked so hard for

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.120
will be wasted.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.200
Please trust me.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.120
I'll wait right here.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.200
But if you don't come out
in thirty minutes,

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.400
I'm breaking the door down
and shooting the ghost for real.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.640
(chanting)

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.760
(chanting)

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.440
(chanting)

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.680
Why are you here?

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.720
You're not welcome here.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.720
I didn't mean to disturb you.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.720
I just want to ask about
the ritual that sacrificed seven bodies.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.840
My craft.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.720
Why do you want to know?

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.399
What does the one who did it want?

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:18.600
You already know.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.399
That everything here

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.800
comes with a price.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.520
Make an offering.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.520
It's a life-extension ritual.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.440
Taking life force

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.800
from those sacrificed.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.720
Once it starts, it can't stop.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.920
Someone performed this sacrifice in Sisaket

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.720
fifteen years ago, right?

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.480
I came here with the Grandmaster Monk.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.520
Not fifteen years ago.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.720
The first time

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.400
was twenty-five years ago.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.856
That cop chased a thief into my house.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.000
He was stabbed by my enchanted blade.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.120
That's when it took hold.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.880
That cop never realized

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.800
his life was already doomed.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.360
Hey, calm down.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.840
Let me take a look at the wound.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.920
It's possessed.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.400
These things

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.040
are drawn to vengeful minds.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.240
They come to take your life.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.320
Within three days, seven days.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.800
And not just you.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.800
Your son too.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.520
Help me.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.800
How do I fix this?

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.600
There is a way.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.920
But will you do everything I say?

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.736
What did you do?

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.480
- Let me go.
- Chaba.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.200
Besides making offerings to ghosts,

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.880
to extend life,

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.560
the ritual also forces the ghost

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.200
to do what it's commanded.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.000
It can't be reborn.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:29.000
(chanting)

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:34.080
The eyes were stitched
so the spirit couldn't see or search.

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:36.960
The mouth was stitched,

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.080
so it couldn't curse anyone.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:45.520
Who was that cop?

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.920
He wasn't from Sisaket.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.680
You're destined to find him.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.400
Because if you don't,

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.920
everyone will die.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.800
Thup.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.000
What happened?

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.480
Thup.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.880
What did your hand touch?

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.840
Which ghost did this to you?

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.600
I'll go in and shoot it dead one more time.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.200
Calm down, P'Singha.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.120
No one can hurt me.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.800
I did this myself.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.040
You promised me you'd be fine
once you went in.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.000
I had to do it.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.800
But now I know the truth.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.000
What the killer really wants.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.520
Don't worry about work.
Worry about yourself.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.400
Go get that wound treated
at the hospital.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.560
Go.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.680
- Hello, Dr. Darin.
- Hello.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.056
Here to pick up your lab results?

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.616
Please wait a moment.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:17.880
You can sit inside first.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.120
Thank you.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.000
Hey, are you doing okay?

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.280
Why do you ask?

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.640
You don't look very well.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.120
Have you been getting enough sleep?

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.480
Ever since I got the Tukkata Sia-Kaban,

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.520
I haven't been sleeping well.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.920
Why?

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.320
Do I really look that bad?

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.920
It's pretty obvious you're
not getting enough sleep.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.536
To be honest,

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.160
I don't really believe in
this kind of thing either.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.240
But I've heard elders back home say

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.120
when someone's weak or worn down,

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.800
bad things get to them more easily.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.000
No need to worry about Darin.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.600
I'm taking good care of him.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.656
I saw Sergeant Khem and Dab

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.136
going together to get holy water sprinkled
at the temple, just for peace of mind.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.800
I don't know if it actually helps.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.800
Why don't you try it, Doctor?

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.280
No.

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.600
I'm busy.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.640
Doctor's got a lot of work.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.400
And cops don't?

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.600
Just here for the lab results.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:26.800
Okay.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.800
Good. Then I can head back quickly,

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.200
so I'm not in the way of
people around here.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.920
Honestly,

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.040
if the Tukkata Sia-Kaban
is still bothering you,

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.040
maybe try going to a temple
or making merit.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.080
It's better than doing nothing.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.880
Inspector, has Inspector Sing
contacted you from Sisaket yet?

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.440
Not yet, Sergeant.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.320
Am I interrupting something?

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:13.120
I've got something important
to discuss with Inspector King.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.600
Go on.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.680
When are you finally going to wrap up

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.600
this human sacrifice case?

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.496
How long are you going to let

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.320
the people upstairs stay worried?

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.120
I… I think it'll be soon, Dad.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.336
Do you know how embarrassed I am,

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.680
having transferred my own son here

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.040
and then having to answer everyone

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:51.200
why the head of investigations
can't get the job done?

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.360
Send all the information
on the seven-body sacrifice

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.120
to my people.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.400
I'll personally step in
and take over this case.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.656
You can't interfere in everything
and force it your way.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.200
I'm not interfering.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.920
And if you and your old friends

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.520
still can't get anything done,

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.320
this is what you'll face.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.800
Thank you very much.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:34.560
Oh?

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.480
Hey, lunch break's only an hour.

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:39.040
Where did you sneak off to?

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.200
Well,

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.800
I had an urgent family matter.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.120
Sorry I didn't report it by the book.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.400
It's fine.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.000
Work's not heavy anyway.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.120
But that “urgent matter”,

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.400
need any help?

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.480
No.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.000
I've handled it already.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.800
From now on,

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.880
there shouldn't be anything
to worry about.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.840
You must've messed with
something bad.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.640
That's why ghosts won't leave you alone.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.600
He wants to take me with him.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.280
But I don't want to go.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.320
Could you help send him away?

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.920
He won't leave easily.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.120
You need to spread goodwill,
build a lot of merit.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.120
Then he'll let go.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:46.280
It might not be just us who are in danger.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.520
But the people we love,

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.880
and those close to us,

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.200
could be dragged in too.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.200
So where is it?

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.440
Want me to help run the lab results?

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.280
This case is going into surgery tomorrow.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.960
Forensics already sent the evidence.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.720
But can you help run the DNA
of this victim first?

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.800
- Sure.
- Okay.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.280
Let's do it.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.680
The injection's nowhere near the heart.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.520
Why are you screaming so loud?

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.200
I'm fragile and delicate, you know.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.520
Not tough like P'Singha.

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.400
Serves you right.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.000
Who told you to slice your own hand?

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.080
I didn't do it for fun.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.400
I did it to get information.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.160
If it ever comes to offering blood
to ghosts,

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.080
you don't have to do it again.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.320
I don't want you getting hurt in my place.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.920
I did it to protect P'Singha.

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.640
I didn't do it for no reason.

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.920
Sit here and wait.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.120
I'll go pay.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.600
Can you tell me anything more?

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.120
He has a sick son.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.600
But his ritual,

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.520
Not just for himself,

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.640
but for his son too.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.200
How pathetic.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.920
Excuse me.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.736
Do you have a pediatric department here?

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:43.720
Yes.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.496
We're the first hospital in Sisaket

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.720
to have a dedicated pediatric department.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.480
How many years has this hospital been open?

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.000
Over twenty years now.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.337
P'Singha,

00:16:58.361 --> 00:17:00.536
do you remember what I told you,

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:04.280
about the shaman saying the cop involved

00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:06.079
had a sick son?

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:10.000
I already had local police
look into that cop.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.400
I think

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.079
we should try asking

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.520
for his child's medical history here.

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.119
That works.

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:21.536
I'm Inspector Singha.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.176
I'd like to request cooperation
to review pediatric patient records

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.319
from about twenty-five years ago.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.160
I'll need to consult the director first.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.720
And, Officer, you'll need to notify
local authorities to coordinate tomorrow.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.520
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.120
- Yes, thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.000
Then,

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.800
let's stay in town tonight.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.400
So we can finish this tomorrow.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.000
P'Singha,

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.000
you're not planning anything, right?

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.720
Planning what?

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.000
What?

00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:00.600
Quit acting like an artist.
Be a cop already.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.000
Well, my boyfriend's a cop.
I've gotta be smart enough to keep up.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.120
Who's your boyfriend?

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.520
I already told you.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.200
Finish the case first. We'll talk after.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.520
Okay.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.600
Finish it first.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.120
Then it'll be clear.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.680
What's wrong with him?

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.440
Hello.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.056
Do you have any rooms available tonight?

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.760
Yes. What type of room would you like?

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.440
We'll take, - Any type is fine.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.960
But we'll need two rooms.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.080
Sure, no problem.

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.120
One room is enough.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.880
We understand each other now.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.320
That we'd take separate rooms.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.080
We're here for work.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:11.000
The government budget isn't big enough
to split rooms.

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.880
Sorry, one room then.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:17.320
Alright, one room with a queen-size bed.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.720
One bed is fine.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.080
It gets cold at night.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.480
Sleeping together keeps warm.

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.240
But I like sleeping alone.

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.400
You'll see.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.120
Here's your key card.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.600
Thank you.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.440
Or is it…

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.600
A couple having a fight?

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.560
If we catch the killer,

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.600
does that make us official?

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.600
You really care that much
about being official or not?

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.800
Being together is between two people.

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.400
What others think doesn't
really matter, right, Thup?

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.200
If there weren't other variables,
it wouldn't matter.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.800
But you do have another variable.

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.320
Inspector King.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.200
Thup.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:53.600
I've been clear with you all along.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.320
And you're still being possessive.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.920
I am.

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.840
There's a reason to be.

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.640
No idea when he'll try to take you back.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.520
Listen to me.

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.480
Whether he can take you back or not,

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.000
that's on me.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.720
It's got nothing to do with him.

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.720
You drove a long way.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.000
Your back must hurt.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.320
Turn around.

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.120
Turn around.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.320
Thanks.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.920
You need to take better care
of your back.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:51.200
Good thing I brought this.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.520
That's about it during work trips.

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.000
Are you expecting someone?

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:40.600
I need to talk.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.920
My dad said if nothing changes,

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.800
he'll come down and run the case himself.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.480
So I came to tell you.

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.440
Is Big Pong going after me again?

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.000
Go tell your dad

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.120
to have some shame
in front of the public.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.520
I won't let your dad
pin Thup's case again.

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:20.200
After all this time,
you still don't know my dad?

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.880
He never listens to anyone.

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.056
Because of people like your dad,

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.120
good cops have it hard.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.280
So what have you got so far in Sisaket?

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.920
What I found is,

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.336
the person who studied dark arts

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.800
with the shaman who knew
the seven-body sacrifice ritual

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.880
was a former local cop,

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.600
and he was linked to past
black magic cases too.

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.520
A cop.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:52.920
If he's really the one behind it,
he'd know how to cover his tracks.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.536
That could also explain

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.600
why he's been so hard to find.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.000
He has a sick son too.

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.600
Probably around my age.

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.760
I think the reason he performed the ritual

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.320
was to save his son.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:10.680
Hold on.

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.320
The information you got,

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.520
is it reliable?

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.520
It's the best we've got right now.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:24.120
Tomorrow I'll dig deeper at the hospital.

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.080
Good.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.280
I agree.

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.720
Hospitals always keep patient records.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.920
Can you issue a warrant for me?

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.200
So I don't have to explain too much.

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.800
Patient information is confidential.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.720
I can issue the warrant.

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.920
But I'm not letting you go alone, Singha.

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.400
I'm going with you.

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.400
Investigating is a cop's job.

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.320
Not whatever you're doing,
dragging civilians into it.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.320
Tomorrow. Seven a.m.

00:25:58.321 --> 00:26:08.535
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:25:58.560 --> 00:25:59.880
Don't be late.

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.600
I didn't ask him to come.
He came on his own.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.400
I didn't say anything about you.

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.200
Why are you getting defensive?

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.080
Who's defensive?

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:41.720
I didn't do anything wrong.

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.360
I know it's work.

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:09.120
You two still have to work together anyway.

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:15.000
I'll try to be more mature.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.720
Very good.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.520
That's the right attitude.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.680
But I'll bet a million,

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.520
Inspector King still likes you.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:30.800
Don't get insecure.

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.640
Whatever King thinks is his problem.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.800
This is between us.

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.200
It's good that he showed up.

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:52.120
He can help me get the job done.

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.320
He may look like that,

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:55.800
but he's got skills.

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.800
And another thing,

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.400
if we close the case,

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.320
you and I can be official.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.600
The way you want.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.120
Are you serious?

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.200
Dead serious.

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:11.400
I'll even post it online
seven days, seven nights.

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:13.880
But…

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:17.000
Tonight you have to sleep with me.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.640
On the bed.

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.400
No way.

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:25.216
Save your energy for work tomorrow.

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.880
I'll sleep on the floor.

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.336
Where are you going?

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:29.600
I'll sleep somewhere else.

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.920
My arm hurts.

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:00.800
Hey.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.200
What?

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.800
What are you applying?

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.720
Apply it like this.

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.000
Like this?

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.400
You look better.

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:31.120
You actually used the cream
I recommended.

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:38.120
If I'm about to go public,
I've gotta look good, right?

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.840
Go get ready.

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:50.640
You've got ten minutes.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.600
Don't be late.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:57.040
Roger that, Inspector.

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:07.800
Let's go.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.920
Right on time, Singha.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.600
Same buffer as always.

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.800
I'm not giving you a reason to yell at me.

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.920
Is that the same shampoo scent?

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:30.936
I know you like this one, P'Singha.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.600
So I packed it myself.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.336
P'Singha doesn't care
about little details like that.

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:39.000
I'm the one who looks after them.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.040
What about the hospital?

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.520
The warrant's already been sent.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:51.520
But I still need to confirm
with the director.

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:07.200
Medical records from twenty-five years ago

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.040
are on this floor, in the inner section.

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:12.176
If you have any questions, Officer,

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.880
feel free to ask me. I'll be around.

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.720
Alright, thank you.

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:20.440
Let's move.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.000
Thup.

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.240
What's wrong?

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:03.920
Nothing.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.440
I must've imagined it.

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.280
Found it.

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:35.560
Let's go.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.920
Anuphap Boonprim.

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:49.016
Admitted with SLE,

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.600
an autoimmune disease from birth.

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:02.920
This child

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.880
has medical records only up to age three.

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.600
After that, there are no records here.

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.480
If we count from when he disappeared,

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.000
it lines up with twenty-five years ago.

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:19.640
The time of the first incident

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:20.920
in Sisaket.

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.536
And he's the only one

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.320
around my age.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.120
Excuse me, over here please.

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.240
Yes, Officer.

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:36.736
Anuphap Boonprim,

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:39.256
I'd like to know where his parents are.

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.120
An address, anything at all.

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:46.800
Can you recall anything noteworthy?

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.480
Even small details would help.

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.120
Everything matters now.

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:56.720
Boonprim.

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:02.120
Sounds familiar. There used to be a nurse
with that last name.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:04.320
People called her.

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:06.200
Chaba.

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.120
Give me a moment.

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.400
Chaba.

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:16.120
Here it is.

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:19.440
She left twenty-five years ago.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.920
How do you remember?

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.800
It was a long time ago.

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:28.655
Actually,

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:33.040
nurses who work locally
rarely want to move.

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.456
Everyone wants to stay in their hometown.

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:36.960
But Chaba,

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.719
she suddenly owed the hospital a large
amount in medical bills.

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.280
Then she just disappeared.

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:46.400
What's wrong?

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.800
This person

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:54.920
looks just like the ghost I've been seeing.

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.520
Do you have any information
about people she knew?

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.720
Family or anyone at all.

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.720
In this province or elsewhere.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:10.920
Everyone knew her
husband was a police officer.

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:14.200
At the city police
station, if I recall correctly.

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.720
But no one at the hospital knows him.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.680
Thank you very much.

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:22.600
Thanks again.

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.200
Hello?

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.640
Aunt Srichan?

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.040
Okay, Uncle. I'll head there now.

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:42.537
What happened?

00:35:42.561 --> 00:35:45.680
Longchai called. He said Aunt Srichan
had an accident.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.800
I need to go check on Uncle and Aunt first.

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.440
- I'm coming with you.
- You should stay and work.

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.040
I can call a car myself.

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.600
You sure?

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:59.120
Why are you worrying about Thup?
He's local.

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.320
You need to keep digging into this with me.

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.200
That's true.

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.200
You should go with Inspector King.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.120
If anything happens,

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:11.960
call me right away.

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:14.600
Okay.

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:55.600
I'm Inspector Wachira,
and this is Inspector Singha,

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.600
from the Special Investigation Division.

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.000
We'd like to ask for your cooperation.

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:02.240
Hello, Inspector.

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:03.600
How can I help?

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.136
We're looking for some information.

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:08.320
About a case that happened here
25 years ago.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.600
The ritual sacrifice of seven bodies
on a tree.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.800
A case that old?

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.880
No one around now would remember it,
Inspector.

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:20.880
All the senior officers from back then
have transferred out.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.640
That leaves only…

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.480
Only Sergeant Ket, really.

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.160
He should know something.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:31.880
But Inspector…

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:33.720
You'll have to ask him yourself.

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:36.520
He's a bit unstable these days.

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:38.480
He's currently suspended from duty.

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:41.920
He's over there,
in the records storage room.

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:07.000
I'm Lieutenant Ket Nongbueng.

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.240
Inspector,

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.800
Just call me King.

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:11.960
And this is Sing.

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:14.720
Inspector King. Inspector Sing.

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:17.400
I won't take much of your time.

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.480
I just want to ask you something.

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:23.120
Do you recognize the husband
of this nurse?

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:24.880
He used to be a cop here.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.400
There were tons of cops back then.
I don't know him.

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:32.400
Take a closer look, Sergeant.

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:36.120
Otherwise, it won't just be us
coming down here.

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.800
I'll report this to central command and
request an inspection of operations here.

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:43.000
Wait, Inspector.

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.720
My eyesight hasn't been great just now.

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.800
May I take another look?

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.400
Pannipa Boonprim.

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:54.680
Does that name ring a bell?

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:56.640
Pannipa…

00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:58.080
Boonprim.

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.320
She was Sergeant Atikun's wife.

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.160
Atikun?

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:07.736
Yes. He used to be stationed here.

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.680
I was under his command back then.

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:13.120
I was just a sergeant at the time.

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:17.320
I'll find the files for you, Inspector.
Sorry about that.

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.456
Is this the guy Thup mentioned?

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.800
I can't remember where I put it.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.840
Forty-seven.

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.720
Forty-eight.

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:32.600
Found it.

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:34.680
Here.

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:38.080
Atikun.

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:44.520
Where is he now?

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:47.920
Sergeant Atikun died a long time ago.

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.840
What happened, Uncle Chai?

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:16.120
Your aunt wasn't careful.
She fell down the stairs.

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:17.880
She was being careful.

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:21.200
But this was really a ghost haunting
in broad daylight.

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:23.320
How could anyone be careful against that?

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:25.120
Thup.

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.920
I don't know if your uncle

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.920
went somewhere bad recently,

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:32.400
and brought something bad back with him.

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.920
Maybe…

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:37.600
Maybe it's my fault.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.120
For getting involved.

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.240
It's not related.

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:45.320
It was probably just her bad luck.

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:46.920
Don't overthink it.

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:48.520
Your father,

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.720
But I…

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:53.400
I really saw a female ghost.

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:55.600
A female ghost?

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:00.040
The ghost you saw…

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:01.400
Was it…

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:05.520
With a mouth ripped wide open like this?

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:09.520
Yes. That's the one. Exactly that one.

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:10.800
That one.

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.096
Back then, he was lying in wait
to arrest a suspect,

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:26.216
and got stabbed until
the wound got infected.

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:28.200
No matter how it was
treated, it never healed.

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:33.280
We only heard the news later,
when his wife came to say he had died.

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:35.920
She asked us to send money
for the funeral expenses.

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:40.800
What about the seven-body
sacrifice case in Sisaket?

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.000
Do you remember it?

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:44.680
A case that big,

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:46.520
there's no way anyone would forget.

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:48.960
But before we found the bodies,

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.256
several days had already passed.

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:54.040
No relatives came forward at all.

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:55.880
They were afraid of being cursed.

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:59.920
So we handled them as unclaimed bodies.

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:02.720
Alright then, Sergeant.

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:05.280
I'd like every piece of
information you have,

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:07.400
in case it can be used as confirmation.

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:10.320
There isn't any.

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:13.800
Back then, the case files were just paper.

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:16.200
It's been over twenty years.

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:19.520
If anything existed, termites
would've eaten it all by now.

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.400
- Nothing at all?
- King.

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:29.480
Inspector, Inspector.

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:30.800
Inspector.

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:33.120
I found more documents.

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.720
I found more documents.

00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:52.520
Took long enough.

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:01.200
Thanks.

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:03.600
So now,

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:06.176
you're hiding out with
your aunt and uncle all day.

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:07.720
Won't your boyfriend be upset?

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:11.520
P'Sing and I aren't boyfriends yet.

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:13.040
Not yet?

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.480
That day your uncle misspoke.

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:18.800
But I didn't see him deny it either.

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.200
I'm hoping for that too.

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:26.720
I think I'll head back now.

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:28.680
I don't want to stay with you too long.

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:30.576
I don't want you getting
hurt because of me again.

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:34.000
Why would you say that, Thup?

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:35.760
When you come see us,

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:37.720
we're really happy.

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.040
Alright.

00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.000
I'll get going, Uncle.

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:47.520
- Goodbye.
- Pray before you go.

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:49.600
- Pray, okay?
- Yes.

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.920
- Take care.
- Yes.

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:06.040
Honestly, I wasn't that close with Khuean.

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.040
I'd only been posted
here for less than a year

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:11.200
before he went on the run.

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.400
On the run?

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:16.120
For assaulting his wife and child?

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:19.200
I don't really know the details.

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.520
But I heard that…

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:23.600
Khuean,

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:26.520
he got into a fight with his wife,

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:30.960
lost control, and accidentally killed her
right there at home.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.040
Then he fled.

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:36.800
That's why there's no data in the system.

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.440
Why would it be like that?

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:42.080
Didn't the victim's family
press charges at all?

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:44.600
By the time anyone realized she was dead,

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:46.720
weeks had already passed.

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:48.280
Besides,

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:51.600
his wife was from another area,

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:53.600
and she had no relatives.

00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:00.800
Have you heard any rumors

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.200
about where Ta Khuean might be hiding?

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.520
I heard that…

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:09.280
The reason Ta Khuean fought with his wife

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:10.640
was because

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:14.920
he was having an affair
with that nurse, Chaba.

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:19.000
If you ask where he'd go into hiding,

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:22.320
he probably ran off with Chaba.

00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:34.880
I think…

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:37.680
Even if Sergeant Ket looks like a drunk,

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:40.520
the information he gave is real.

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.320
I'll have Mek go question Ta Khuean.

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:46.520
About the nurse named Chaba.

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:54.400
Hello?

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:55.816
P'Sing.

00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:58.000
I'm about to leave the hospital now.

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:01.520
- Are you back at the room yet?
- Not yet. I'm heading back.

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:08.840
Thup.

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:10.000
Thup.

00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:07.896
Strange. Before seven days of killing,

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:10.720
the first body should've been too
decomposed to hang already, right?

00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:12.056
The killer must have a
way to preserve them.

00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:15.640
This ghost has been protecting me
all along. Do you know who it is, Uncle?

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:18.720
What Ta Khuean said just now
sounded like Atikun isn't dead yet.

00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:21.480
You have to come with me.

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:25.776
Didn't I tell you?
There's no place here for a cop like you.

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:27.280
Just watch me.

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:30.080
Aren't you going to ask
what we were just talking about?

00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:31.920
I won't ask.

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:33.800
I trust you.

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.840
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm a doctor.

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:40.640
(What happens next?)
Here, I'm wearing a lab coat.

00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:43.576
(Drama incoming for sure.) In EP13
he's definitely going to fight with me.

00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:45.480
Thup is going to cry
every episode, for sure.

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:46.856
Don't believe him too much.

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:50.136
(Playing Cupid now?)
I'm the one making them fall in love.

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.880
He gets up like he's packing his things
to sleep somewhere else.

00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:55.656
I follow him, hug him, and spin him around.

00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:57.320
- Can you get down?
- Yeah.

00:48:57.560 --> 00:48:59.200
My arm hurts.
