Ji Li.

=Episode 14=

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.150
In the war,

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.920
the immortals were crushed.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.150
And you

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.600
are the one to blame.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.840
Today,

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.030
in this hall,

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.370
you're convicted
of the following crimes:

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.280
Treason

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.070
and collusion with the demons,

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.350
bringing death and ruin here.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.310
I plead

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.760
guilty.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:16.560
Your Grace,

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.680
Ji Li has committed

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.790
monstrous crimes.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.910
She shall suffer

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.230
a heart-piercing blow,

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.120
with her body slain, soul scattered,

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.710
cast into the wheel of rebirth.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.640
Your Grace, Ji Li has made amends.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.150
She cured immortals

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.350
and drove out demons.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.310
Please spare his life.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.510
Your Grace,

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.120
I'm responsible for Ji Li's fault

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.120
as her master.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.040
Your Grace,

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.430
please spare his life.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.200
I'm willing

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.590
to bear the punishment on her behalf.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.590
Guarding the immortal realm

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:55.840
was always your duty;

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.070
this time,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.200
you too have erred.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.350
Master! Master!

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.190
Your Grace,

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.430
the great war began only because of me;

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.780
let every punishment fall upon me.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.680
It was my fault, not my master's.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.800
- Spare my master!
- Ji Li!

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.640
Ji Li...

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.200
Master,

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.000
I let you down.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.470
I'll accept my punishment.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.470
Enough.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.080
Ji Li will be hanged

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.680
before the Heavenly Gate.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.960
After seven days,

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.630
she'll be cast into the Wasteland

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.800
to ponder her crimes.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.920
Huan Zhen

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.870
broke the Artifact;

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.630
she'll suffer alike.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.710
Yes, Your Grace.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:45.800
I wanted peace,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.740
yet you attacked them.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.560
How dare you!

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.250
Where are Luo Cha and Elder Guo?

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.310
Your Grace,

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.460
after the great battle,

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.680
those two

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.910
vanished without a trace.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.310
Find them.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.910
Search the Three Realms;

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.360
bring them back alive,

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:00.900
or bring back their corpses.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.960
Yes!

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:03.590
Wait.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:04.910
What penalty

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.150
does Ji Li face?

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.600
She'll lose her immortal bones,

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.280
be hung outside the Heavenly Gate,

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.710
and be cast into the Wasteland.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:13.710
For now, you will act

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.280
as regent of the Demon Realm.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.910
Whatever happens,

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.360
do not stir.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.800
If another mistake occurs,

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.430
the realm will vanish.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.750
Your Grace, are you...

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.750
I am going

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:27.750
to the Wasteland.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.420
(Wasteland)

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.960
If not for you,

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.560
I'd never be here.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:55.830
My power is sealed;

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.070
there's no food or shelter here.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.360
A lofty immortal like me

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.520
shouldn't suffer such misery.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.280
Are you listening?

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.630
If you and Master weren't so close,

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.120
I'd never have framed you
out of jealousy.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.560
What's wrong with you?

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.710
Cover that wound now.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:16.720
Wasteland Bears roam here;

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.630
they love blood.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.070
I made a mistake

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.950
and was banished here

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.240
all because of you.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.430
I don't want to die here.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.630
If someone must die,

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:30.470
it'll be you.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.000
Come out!

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.470
Show yourself, or I strike.

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:08.680
Why try to hurt yourself?

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.070
If I hadn't, would you ever appear?

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.560
Why have you followed me all this way?

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.920
Why won't you hear me out?

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.440
What will it take

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.680
for you to trust me again?

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:24.970
There is nothing left to say.

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.720
I said everything

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.070
during the great war.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.390
We are finished

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:32.600
unless you die.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.540
My life is yours to take

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:43.950
whenever you wish.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:46.170
Have you lost your mind?

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.640
Without you,

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.630
I no longer know how to live.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.430
I've made myself clear:

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.000
We're different.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.720
There is no path for us.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.920

I have never deceived you.

If you refuse to tell me the reason,

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.920
it's fine.

Ji Li,

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.920
since you once saved me,

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.680

If you love me,

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.390
why won't you trust me?

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.600
Things have come to this.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.480
What difference

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.030
can my trust still make?

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.030
Give me your trust,

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.120
and I will prove it to you.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.560
Besides,

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.320
I never ordered

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.440
the attack.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.120
A traitor lurked beside me.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.120
On the eve of war,

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.840
someone cast a spell

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.870
that threw me into sleep.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.280
However,

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:12.960
I cast the Tracking Spell

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:14.440
on the one who did it.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.160
Now,

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.710
they've fled into the Wasteland.

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:19.130
If you don't believe me,

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:20.700
you'll let the true culprit escape.

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:23.440
If I speak

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.670
even half a lie,

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:26.750
I will never appear

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:28.390
before you again.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.960
The last time.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.600
This is the final chance.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.840
Tracking Spell.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:10.600
It seems your brother suspects you.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.360
If your plan had worked,

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:14.320
he'd never doubt me.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:17.550
Ms. Luo, are you here to blame me?

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.870
Rest easy.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.270
Since I promised to help you
finish this cause,

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:24.840
I will clean up the mess for you.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.120
Elder Guo

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.270
has led you into the Wasteland, right?

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.630
If you fear Jie Chuan's blame,

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.320
I can find you

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:46.720
a scapegoat.

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:01.840
Jie Chuan ordered

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.440
the assault on the immortal realm.

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:07.630
Why hunt Luo Cha and me?

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.480
Elder Guo.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:10.840
Your Grace.

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:12.790
In this great war,

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.750
you don't seem to understand

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.120
my deep intentions.

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.360
In the past battles,
I led the army myself;

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:24.080
why did I let you command this one?

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.000
In the great war,

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:29.150
the outcome is never sure.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.360
I chose to let you lead

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:32.710
because if we won,

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:35.390
our great cause would be done,

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.870
and you and I

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:40.270
would shine in history,

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.080
honored by every clan;

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:45.240
if we lose,

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:46.870
you were the commander,

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:49.870
the guilt would rest on you.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.150
I'd simply shove

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.510
the crime of provoking war

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:57.960
onto your shoulders,

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.600
and then ask for peace

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.790
with the immortals.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.240
Either way, I'd be safe.

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:08.080
So,

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.670
from beginning to end,

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.270
I was just your scapegoat.

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:13.670
Exactly.

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:15.550
Elder Guo,

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:28.630
your life

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.480
is mine now.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:39.910
You brat!

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.080
I never knew you were so treacherous!

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.790
Jie Chuan,

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.000
you are unfit to rule the Demon Realm!

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:51.510
Well?

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:52.710
Did it work?

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.320
My illusion

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.240
can bind his threads of love.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:03.030
Now, he's under my control.

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:06.510
Elder Guo,

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.080
why have you come to the Wasteland?

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:12.790
Jie Chuan, I'll kill you!

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.240
Jie Chuan, I'll kill you!

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:17.510
Good.

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:19.910
Very good.

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:27.990
It's right here.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.320
Careful!

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:34.550
Jie Chuan,

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:36.550
how dare you chase me here?

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.670
Elder Guo, it's you.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.270
Give me an answer for the great war.

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:45.630
So, it really was you.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.160
Elder Guo,

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.320
I don't think

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:49.790
you're the real traitor.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.000
If you surrender now,

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.360
I can spare your life

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:54.800
because of your past merits.

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:57.240
Jie Chuan,

00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:59.150
that's your flaw:

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:00.670
hesitant, soft-hearted,

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:01.870
and hypocritical.

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.670
In the Wasteland, your power is drained.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.720
With a wounded burden,

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.270
what can you do to me?

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:17.960
Elder Guo,

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:20.390
where did this demonic aura come from?

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:24.360
Something I obtained years ago.

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:25.750
Jie Chuan,

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:28.200
I am the true Demon Sovereign!

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:29.750
Die!

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:33.030
I will use Soul-Search right now

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.120
to see who hides behind you.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.600
Watch out!
He's going to detonate his soul!

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:49.800
Ji Li!

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:55.390
Ji Li...

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:58.680
Ji Li...

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.560
Jie Chuan,

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:07.720
it's so great that I found out

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.790
you didn't do it.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.120
Ji Li.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.480
I'm dying.

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:30.960
Jie Chuan,

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:33.160
even my scales have changed color.

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:35.000
Ji Li, don't be afraid.

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.360
I'll fetch the treasure
from the Demon Palace.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:38.590
You'll be alright.

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:44.350
My immortal bones are shattered
inch by inch;

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:47.440
I can't survive long in the Wasteland.

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:49.750
Before I die, knowing

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:50.960
it wasn't you...

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:52.310
Ji Li.

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:53.750
I'm so happy.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:55.760
You won't die.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.680
Trust me.

00:17:58.590 --> 00:17:59.440
I believe you.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:00.400
Ji Li.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.110
I've always believed you.

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:08.310
I just realized it too late.
