[The Vendetta of An]

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.100
[The night before]

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.660
My death

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.020
will clear the path for Cen Pickles,

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.210
and the Tiemo King's life

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.820
will draw out the 3,000 Tiemo shadow guards.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.540
This plan is nearing its end.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.540
Fate

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.660
will soon show its hand.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.820
The realm's future

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.740
will soon be known.

[Episode 28]

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.940
[Tea]

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.910
Move!

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.170
Surround Hidden Soldier Alley!

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.170
Yes!

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.650
The people who moved into Hidden Soldier Alley

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.490
brought life back to it,

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.210
but today,

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.900
smoke and fire will return.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.420
Will Mr. Xie Huai'an arrive on time?

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.770
Ye Zheng,

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:33.820
the Shen-hour plan

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.160
cannot afford

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.420
a single misstep.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.210
Therefore,

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.470
you must appear at the exact place

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.580
I designated for you on time

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.300
and wait for me there.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.420
This is the grandest stratagem of his life.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.530
He will not be absent.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:46.030
Run!

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:48.690
Goodbye!

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.810
After him!

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.010
I do not know what tomorrow holds.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:11.890
But today, let us

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.220
say our farewell properly.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.010
If you do that, you will die.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.570
Don't worry.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.180
I promise

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.220
we will meet again.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.330
Your task is crucial.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.100
I believe

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.010
you can

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.690
do it.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.330
I won't die.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.450
And you must not die either.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.960
Everything today

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.460
had been arranged in advance,

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.260
including the pot mender

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.280
and the physician named Yi Zhihu.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.490
What are you hiding

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:28.880
that you cannot tell me outright?

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.570
Very well.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:37.650
I will be honest.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:43.180
Tomorrow,

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.410
I am going to meet the King of Tiemo,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.450
staking my life on this plan.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.820
The pot mender

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.500
is linked to the units I've hidden in the city.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.180
Tomorrow at the Shen hour,

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:57.450
our clash with Tiemo

00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:59.620
will unfold within the city.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.860
And

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.540
what will happen to you?

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.570
When fireworks rise

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.420
at the Shen hour,

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.330
you and Yi Zhihu

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.450
should come to the Tiemo King's residence for me.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:21.330
As for the outcome,

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:23.250
it rests in Heaven's hands.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:31.690
Remember:

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.690
if you act

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:36.180
before the Shen hour,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.100
you will alert them,

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.780
and the entire plan

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.570
will collapse.

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:46.690
You must not die.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.010
One man's life

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:54.660
is nothing beside the fate

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.010
of Chang'an.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:58.890
Besides,

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.250
Yi Zhihu's medical skill

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.330
matches your master's.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:06.060
Perhaps

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:07.890
she will keep me alive.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:31.940
Sir,

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:33.330
the two of them

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.780
split in two directions.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:36.540
We lost them both.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.140
Had Genghui been here,

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:42.250
we wouldn't have failed.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.420
But did Xie Huai'an truly risk his life

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.030
just to draw Fang Genghui away

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.210
and rescue Xiao Wenjing?

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.360
Stay back!

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:57.780
Xiao Wenjing,

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.140
you are not useless after all.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.140
But don't forget

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.300
that Xiao Wuyang is still in our hands.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.420
He's in Yulong Ridge, isn't he?

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:10.690
Someone is already on the way to save him.

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:24.540
Kill them!

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.090
Break through!

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:27.630
Charge!

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.820
Kill Xiao Wuyang!

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:08.140
You won't be able to rescue Xiao Wuyang.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.770
Even if we fail,

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.730
the Tiemo King will die in Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:14.730
At worst,

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:17.660
we trade one life for another.

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:24.320
Sir.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:32.880
Report!

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:38.900
Sir,

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.650
large numbers of Wuyang troops appeared in the city.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:41.840
They've surrounded Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:42.970
Hidden Soldier Alley?

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:46.450
Is His Majesty still in his residence?

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:45.970
Zheng.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:48.070
Has he returned?

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:50.650
He has.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.660
This is the next move.

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.820
[The Tiemo King will be locked in battle with Yan Fengshan.]

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.210
We've fallen into Xie Huai'an's trap.

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:14.500
His Majesty

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.460
has been taken by Cen Pickles.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.220
Surround Hidden Soldier Alley!

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:38.500
Breaking into the granary

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:39.770
will not be easy.

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:40.520
[Map of Yanzuo Ward]

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.620
They made the first move.

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:44.140
The whole ward must have become a trap.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:45.760
Xie Huai'an

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.130
wants to force a decisive battle.

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:52.030
Hidden Soldier Alley is certainly a trap.

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:53.760
The guards at the Imperial Guard Station

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:56.740
may not be able to break through.

00:14:58.750 --> 00:14:59.530
Notify every shadow guard

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:00.640
in the city to armor up

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:01.800
and converge

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:03.300
on Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:04.000
Understood.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.380
I know your concern.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:15.970
To expose the shadow guards

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.900
is to reveal our last cards.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.540
But Genghui,

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.570
His Majesty cannot die.

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:24.300
If he falls,

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:25.660
even if our army

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:26.810
takes Chang'an,

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:28.610
trouble will never end.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.330
For years,

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:51.780
our 3,000 shadow guards have scouted

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.180
every corner of Chang'an,

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.970
including Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:58.690
This spot has long been piled with clutter,

00:15:58.720 --> 00:15:59.750
poorly guarded,

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.160
and forgotten.

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:05.450
From here,

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:07.610
we can cut straight into the alley.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.230
Stay close. Move!

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:45.210
The formation inside Hidden Soldier Alley is already set.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.820
The breach on the west side

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:48.180
was left there on purpose.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.990
It is the death gate laid for the Tiemo forces.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.340
To save their king,

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.250
they will enter through it.

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:56.870
Once they're in,

00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:59.200
they will never leave.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.340
Among Tiemo forces,

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:07.990
only centurions and above

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:09.360
carry the command arrows,

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:11.750
and a centurion

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:13.940
is hard to kill.

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:15.550
Ye Zheng,

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:17.360
this is your task.

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:19.400
Gather the command arrows.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:20.580
They will be

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:21.850
of great use to us.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.820
The Tiemo King is not in Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.340
The Wuyang Army's blockade

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:53.640
is only a performance to mislead the Tiemo people.

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:50.220
The command arrow

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:53.020
is their signal for reinforcements.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.900
More shadow guards, armored and armed,

00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:59.660
will break in from the west side of the alley

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:01.460
and walk straight into our trap.

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:04.280
Tiemo will commit all its strength

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:05.860
and have no cards left.

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:08.940
We will put everything to an end

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:11.260
in Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:26.660
Even if you kill me,

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:30.730
you still...

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:45.840
Are there more enemies?

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:47.370
All dead.

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:07.500
What is it?

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:09.370
By now,

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:11.890
inside the granary,

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.370
the victor has been decided.

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:34.460
After all these years,

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:37.460
you are still trapped in that granary.

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:39.540
Today,

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.170
you will not walk out either.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.130
I've always wanted to ask you something.

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:16.650
On that snowy night,

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:18.540
why did you spare him?

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:25.850
They say

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:27.870
that in Mount Shiluoman,

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:31.130
there is a rare

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:32.980
and ugly toad.

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:34.660
A toad?

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:37.850
When it meets its own kind,

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:40.700
it is frightened by the other's ugliness

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:43.570
and exudes an oil in shock,

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:46.740
only then realizing

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.890
it is just as ugly.

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:53.980
The tale exists.

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:55.370
That oil

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:57.300
is said to be the world's only cure for regret.

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:07.370
I spared Yan Fengshan that night

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:12.890
because I thought of that toad.

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:15.890
In his eyes,

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.460
I seemed to see myself.

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:28.010
Finish it, White Hair.

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:40.700
No.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.810
You must die slowly.

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:47.220
That hurts more.

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:51.940
A traitor like you

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.610
should have died long ago.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.130
Speak.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.130
Why did you rebel?

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.180
You never walked out

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.770
of the Liu Manor

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.320
from the night it fell 15 years ago.

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.400
I never walked out

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:15.920
of the granary at Chen Valley either.

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:18.720
I've always believed

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:21.680
that only by killing everyone

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.130
can I stay alive.

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:30.860
Aren't you the same?

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:33.650
Yes.

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.890
Only by killing my enemies

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.940
can I go on living.

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:42.220
In truth,

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:46.370
you and I share one enemy.

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:50.260
The one who drove me into that granary.

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:53.810
He took part in killing your father.

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:56.060
On the night your family was massacred,

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.710
he stood in the shadows.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.320
You remember him,

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:03.620
but you do not know him.

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:05.980
After I die,

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:07.940
he will come.

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:22.040
The Huben Army's top shadow guard

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:24.570
must have made preparations

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:27.440
for his death.

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:30.220
Somewhere in this house,

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.370
there must be a head wearing a face made to look like yours.

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.410
Why did you return?

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:16.680
After that night,

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:20.070
I sat on the street for a long time.

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:23.570
The streets of Chang'an

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:25.700
truly have fine scenery.

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:28.500
People came and went,

00:29:28.935 --> 00:29:49.835
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.330
living their lives as usual.

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:36.520
No one spoke of Yan Fengshan's

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:39.120
rise or fall.

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:45.170
Tomorrow at the Shen hour,

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.220
fight for Chang'an,

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:52.290
and you will finally walk out of that granary.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:54.740
Your ending

00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:57.370
is yours to choose.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:09.500
Thank you for granting me this chance.

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:11.300
I am granting nothing.

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:16.930
You killed my family.

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:20.170
The Liu clan will never forgive you.

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:29.930
You carved this amulet

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.500
for Liu Li back then.

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:37.020
Now that the realm is in peril,

00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:40.380
I use it

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:44.390
to buy your life

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.100
and return it to Chang'an.

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.540
White Hair,

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:43.690
I owe you nothing now,

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:48.960
and I owe Chang'an nothing.

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.500
Even if we cannot save His Majesty,

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.650
even if I die here today,

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:07.020
there are still 200,000 Tiemo troops

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:09.490
in your lands.

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:11.310
In half a day's time,

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:14.050
they will reach Chang'an.

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:15.880
When they arrive,

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:18.650
the city will run with blood.

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:25.130
You think

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.450
Xie Huai'an did not foresee that?

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:33.500
The Baiwenhu Army fell so easily

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:35.650
because that was Gu Yu's stratagem.

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:37.690
By not fighting to the death,

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:40.300
they preserved most of their forces.

00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:41.930
For this,

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:44.500
Xie Huai'an devised his master plan.

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:47.690
As the Tiemo army marched south,

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:49.740
Xie Huai'an's messenger

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:52.500
met with the four regional commanders.

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.410
If they refused

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:56.650
to help break the siege of Chang'an,

00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:58.340
the Baiwenhu Army

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:00.340
would immediately take Xie Huai'an's order

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:01.890
and attack them.

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.820
The choice between perishing together

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:05.450
and standing united

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:06.410
against Tiemo

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:08.140
should be

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:11.450
easy to make, shouldn't it?

00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:19.570
By now,

00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:21.620
your Tiemo army

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:24.220
should already be under attack from all sides.

00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:27.570
Impossible.

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:29.530
How so?

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:32.180
I see.

00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:34.380
The military reports you received

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:35.450
did not say any of this,

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:37.060
did they?

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.330
Xie Huai'an and the Huben Army have reconciled.

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:46.890
That force, skilled in disguise

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.300
and infiltration,

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:49.410
was his by right.

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:52.030
They merely did what they excelled at

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.700
and slipped into your

00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:55.280
intelligence network.

00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:57.550
So for the past three days,

00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:59.010
every report you received

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:02.300
was exactly what we wanted you to see.

00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:08.370
By the way,

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:11.260
the battle in Hidden Soldier Alley was also a ruse,

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:12.540
meant to draw out

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:14.260
every shadow guard you had

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:15.340
in the city.

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:17.220
And one more thing.

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:18.370
The Tiemo King

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.700
was never here.

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:26.490
By now,

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:28.660
he should already be dead

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:29.570
somewhere else.

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:43.970
Accept defeat.

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:00.700
You wanted an alliance with me, didn't you?

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:03.260
Then sign

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:04.820
this treaty

00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:07.340
and withdraw your troops.

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:09.740
Otherwise,

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:12.600
two generations of Tiemo's strength,

00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:14.740
every man fit to ride

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:16.010
into battle,

00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:17.970
will die.

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.700
None will be able to return home.

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:49.700
[The Emperor pays respects to the King of Tiemo.]

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:51.700
[Envoy Wuyin Chong proposes to cease the war and restore the lands.]

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:52.900
[A new pact shall be forged to bring peace among the peoples.]

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.180
White Hair?

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.550
Yan Fengshan died for you.

00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:37.740
And Cen Pickles risked everything for you.

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:41.870
You truly are something.

00:39:58.470 --> 00:40:00.090
They did not risk their lives for me.

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:06.090
They only wished

00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:08.300
to protect the grain and flour of Chang'an.

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:29.970
You asked me what I lived for.

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:36.410
I live

00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:41.290
for that same grain and flour.

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:52.300
Since it's over the grain and flour,

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.050
you and I are enemies.

00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:57.140
If you die here,

00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:59.660
no one will know.

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:01.780
I spent years planning

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:04.570
before returning to Chang'an

00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:09.930
to destroy the entire Huben Army,

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:16.620
yet I failed to realize

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:20.610
I was one of them.

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:24.640
My father

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:28.260
raised the Huben Army for Chang'an.

00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:30.260
Every member is a shadow guard.

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:33.310
So many died

00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:35.050
without leaving their names behind.

00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:39.570
That is the price of protection.

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:44.090
For a Huben guard,

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:46.090
to kill the enemy

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:48.570
is the highest merit.

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:50.450
You think

00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:52.740
you can win?

00:41:58.390 --> 00:42:00.700
The shadow guards you hid in the city

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:02.850
all believe you are trapped

00:42:02.850 --> 00:42:04.780
in the granary of Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:07.860
The remnants of the Baiwenhu Army

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.620
and the forces of the four regional commanders

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:14.740
have already united.

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.860
The entire heartland of our empire

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:21.660
has become a trap for your Tiemo army.

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:24.700
Do you think

00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:27.180
you can win?

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:29.790
As long as I live,

00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:33.410
the victor is not yet decided.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.010
White Hair,

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:44.970
you

00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:50.300
forced yourself here on sheer will alone.

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:53.780
How do you plan to kill me?

00:42:57.310 --> 00:42:59.410
Can your hands, meant for writing and pouring tea,

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:01.890
even lift a sword?

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:06.970
Can the words

00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:09.660
"protect Chang'an" kill me?

00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:12.410
No.

00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:15.490
But another phrase can.

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.140
Fifteen years ago, in the Grand Academy,

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:25.930
when you taught us to make funnel timers,

00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:28.740
you said six words.

00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:24.140
The room is full of flour dust.

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:26.660
You should "settle the dust to prevent fire."

00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:28.780
Remember?

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.400
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:41.530
With a broken body,

00:44:42.830 --> 00:44:44.740
I kill the King of Tiemo.

00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:46.220
Today,

00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:48.010
I win!

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:30.700
After tomorrow,

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:33.450
I hope Chang'an

00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:36.340
can still know such peace.

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:39.570
But you

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:41.300
will be gone then.

00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:48.300
The plan is set.

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:51.140
Whether I am here or not

00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:53.970
won't matter.

00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:00.700

00:46:02.350 --> 00:46:03.530
