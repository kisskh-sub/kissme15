=A Vow in the Dark=

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.230
Ji Li.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.600
=Episode 12=
You conspired with Jie Chuan

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.070
to smash the Sun Artifact's barrier.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.350
Was it to steal the Artifact?

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.280
Do you confess?

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.360
Your Grace,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.430
I did see Jie Chuan yesterday,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.400
but I absolutely did not damage
the Artifact.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.960
What about you,

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.150
Jie Chuan?

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.840
Why would I destroy some trinket?

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.560
How dare you

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.280
frame me?

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.560
If not you,

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.120
why was a dragon scale found
beside the barrier?

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.920
Where were you two

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.790
last night?

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.920
Tell us now.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.710
Last night, we never left

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.880
the Forbidden Land.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.040
How can you prove it?

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.190
He can prove it.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.910
Ji Li is

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.150
a weak immortal.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.480
How could she survive a night there?

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.510
I didn't want to alarm anyone,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.070
so I used a scale

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.510
to shield her heart.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.120
She slept through the night in my arms,

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.280
and thus she woke up unharmed.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.150
What nonsense are you spouting?

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.120
You turned into a Candle Dragon,

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.680
so I fell asleep by accident.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.910
Don't slander me.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.360
You two

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.360
are so shameless.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.310
As for the scale beside the Artifact,

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.840
it must be a schemer

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.520
who was watching us

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.960
and stole it when we weren't looking.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.920
Ridiculous!

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.750
Immortals

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.240
would never stoop

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.800
to the sordid deeds you describe;

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.430
it's all an empty excuse.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.560
Why would you protect

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.840
an immortal with a dragon scale?

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.360
Jie Chuan,

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.310
you have no proof at all.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.310
The case is closed:

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.910
Ji Li confesses;

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:47.730
she shall await sentence.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.640
Your Grace,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.680
I was also deceived by Jie Chuan;

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.000
I never damaged the Artifact.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.310
The real culprit

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.560
is still at large,

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.290
which would cause an endless danger.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.310
For the Immortal Realm,

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.190
I beg three days

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.590
to find evidence

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.560
and give the realm the truth.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.360
Very well.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Three days.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.920
Ji Li,

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.150
solve the case;

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.800
redeem your fault.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.470
Jie Chuan, within three days,

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.080
you may stay here,

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.280
but make no reckless moves.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.150
Should you stir at all,

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.960
Ji Li will be struck

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.070
from the immortal rolls forever.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.030
Feng Tian!

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:37.910
Yes, Your Grace.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.310
(So, Jie Chuan truly loves her.)

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.610
(The plan to destroy the demons)

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.840
(is almost within reach;)

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.750
(the Three Realms will soon be
at peace again.)

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:51.590
Ji Li,

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.430
you fell in love
with the Demon Sovereign?

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.310
What love?

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.590
Stop your nonsense.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.430
I'm being framed,
and you don't even comfort me;

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.710
you just gossip.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.630
I'm asking because I care!

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.710
Finding the culprit can wait;

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.710
what matters is

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.430
that your beloved is Jie Chuan!

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.960
Still,

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.000
Jie Chuan is over 1,00 years old;

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.720
you're barely 300.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.610
Don't let him fool you.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.720
I'm telling you:

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.800
Be careful.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.310
Don't get too close to demons;

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.510
they're bloodthirsty,

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.430
fierce,

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.920
and ruthless.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.600
Think it through!

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.600
Oh, enough already!

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.070
I need your help.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.390
I have a plan to clear my name,

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.630
but I need to borrow some water
from Flowing Star.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:41.470
No problem.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.800
Come back with me now for it?

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.120
Better not.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.390
I'm still a criminal.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.410
Besides,

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.950
Jie Chuan is still around.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.480
If you dare bully Ji Li,

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.310
even the Demon Sovereign
won't get off lightly.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.190
Hurry up. I'm waiting.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.630
Okay, okay!

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.830
You should keep your distance

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.870
to avoid rumors.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:07.950
What if they aren't rumors?

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.600
All the immortals know

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.470
- that last night...
- It's all your fault!

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.800
It takes two to clap.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.190
Ji Li,

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.000
I brought the water you asked for.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.480
Have you found anything?

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.680
A special mark.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.720
What kind of mark?

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.360
What were they just saying?

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.510
Top secret.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.430
I can't tell you.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.550
Just make sure Flowing Star

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.070
is sealed tight for the next few days.

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.920
Why?

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:59.590
Look.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.000
Someone dropped the dragon scale
beside the Artifact

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.830
to frame Jie Chuan and me.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.120
What they don't know is

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.390
that the scale has
Jie Chuan's glow powder;

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.950
only water from Flowing Star
can wash it off.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.750
If the river isn't guarded,

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.870
the culprit could rinse the powder away

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.560
while pretending to be fooling around.

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.800
Flowing Star can wash off
the glow powder?

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.560
That's huge!

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.510
This is important.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.680
You must keep it secret.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.560
You mustn't

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.120
tell anyone.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.630
Ji Li, trust me.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.270
I won't let you down.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:37.470
I'll surely guard the secret.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.310
(Ying Ge loves to gossip.)

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.700
(Whatever she knows,)

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.220
(all Three Realms hear within a day.)

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.050
(I'll just wait by the trap.)

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:07.510
The net is spread.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.070
My name will be cleared soon.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:12.600
By glow powder?

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.190
I'm afraid you'll catch nothing.

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:19.030
Why?

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.680
I am the immortals' prime enemy;

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:23.430
my dragon scales

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.920
have been studied for ages.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:28.680
If there really were glow powder,

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:30.260
it would've been spotted long ago.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.480
Your plan

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.520
won't work.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.750
Why didn't you say so?

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.000
You wanted to mock me?

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.240
If you want the truth,

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:44.760
I'll help.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.200
You have a way?

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.400
What's wrong?

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.750
If you want the culprit,

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:53.390
behave yourself.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.260
That night in the Forbidden Land,

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.600
I sensed a third person's power.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:17.560
I've started the Tracking Spell.

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:19.600
If their power

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.070
reacts with the Demonic Ether,

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:22.830
we'll have them.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.290
Every immortal has a spirit root;

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.070
once tainted by my scale

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:28.630
and caught in the spell,

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.220
their aura will twist.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.200
Jie Chuan,

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:05.470
this is the Immortal Realm;

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:06.440
don't get close to me.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.440
There.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:19.390
In the south west,

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:21.030
whose palace is it?

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.200
Huan Zhen?

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:34.350
Huan Zhen,

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.030
why is it you?

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:38.110
Huan Zhen,

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.030
we have the same master.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:41.630
Why frame me?

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:43.510
Frame?

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:46.350
Yes.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:48.240
I smashed the Sun Artifact,

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.550
but did I frame you?

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.840
Wasn't it you who proposed

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.510
sharing the Artifact with demons?

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.750
Is that not collusion?

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.150
(She begged the Artifact for demons?)

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.870
Your Grace,

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.390
immortals and demons

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:07.320
have battled without end,

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:08.870
leaving corpses

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and wailing.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.200
Innocent people in Hunling City
have also suffered from it.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.030
We're seemingly enemies,

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.320
but in truth,

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:18.390
we fight only to survive.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.390
All beings have spirits

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.240
and the right to live.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:23.470
Immortals claim

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:25.910
to guard every life under heaven;

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.510
are the demons

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:30.270
not also lives under heaven?

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:31.870
What the demons seek

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:33.080
is only a patch of sunlight.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.790
If we share the Artifact,

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.990
I believe

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.390
the two realms can live in harmony,

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:42.360
and a peaceful era will come.

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:44.120
Well said.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:46.910
The feud between the two realms

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.320
does not need

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:49.750
to be settled by force.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:51.390
Feng Tian,

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.840
we are both sovereigns.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:54.750
Our first duty

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.320
is to shield our people

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:58.910
in peace.

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:01.600
If you share the Artifact

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.200
and let us cultivate spirit plants

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.600
to drive away the Miasma,

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:06.710
I swear

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:08.320
we shall never have war

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.200
but live in harmony

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:11.630
with immortals.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.200
What a pity

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:16.480
that I don't have the Artifact.

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.870
If I had,

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.000
we'd gladly share it with the immortals.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.550
(Jie Chuan is so eloquent.)

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.750
(But I'll never trust a demon.)

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.280
(Still,)

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.390
(Jin Li's soul is not yet formed,)

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.000
(and Jie Chuan is hard to kill;)

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.960
(for now, I must play along)

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:35.600
(and keep him steady.)

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.280
Jie Chuan,

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:39.870
you must keep your word.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:41.840
When have I ever

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.440
cheated you?

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:46.590
Good.

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:49.240
Huan Zhen will be confined for now

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:50.510
for later punishment.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.720
Three days later,

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.240
the two realms

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:55.510
shall parley for peace

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:57.390
in the hall.

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:17.240
Jie Chuan, wonderful!

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:18.720
We'll have peace.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.670
It's settled!

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:21.600
We won't have to fight anymore.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:24.350
What's wrong?

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:26.920
Nothing.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:29.240
My wounds have not fully healed.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.360
Are you okay?

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:35.840
I'm fine.

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:38.030
My memories just returned,

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.840
so I must return to rest.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.750
Once the peace is sealed,

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.280
there will be

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.840
no more camps dividing us.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.550
Was your offer of peace

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:47.840
spoken from the heart?

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:49.230
Of course.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.930
I'll neither cheat
nor hide anything from you.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.440
What else?

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.670
What else?

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.280
Well...

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.550
No more calling me stupid,

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:02.960
no more locking me,

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.270
and no more striking my master!

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:05.590
Master?

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.040
Still thinking of Hong Zhua?

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:09.840
Quite a list.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.670
Going to back out?

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.320
You should keep your word.

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:16.230
What?

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:20.470
Fine.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.870
I'll keep my word.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.280
(Ji Li,)

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.240
(whatever trap Feng Tian sets,)

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:28.870
(I will protect you.)

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:35.680
Jie Chuan,

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.600
have you truly decided on peace?

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:39.630
Can the immortals' words

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:41.510
be trusted?

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.040
I believe them.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.580
You just believe in Ji Li.

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:46.480
Have you forgotten?

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.870
The immortals used to hunt me.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.120
They wouldn't spare even a half-blood,

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:54.390
much less demons they deem filth.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:56.680
This peace

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.270
is a bait of Feng Tian

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.440
and Ji Li.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:01.670
My affairs

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.720
are not yours to meddle in.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:06.840
This concerns the entire clan.

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:09.150
How can I let private feelings rule you?

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:11.230
Your Grace,

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.080
have you fallen in love with her?

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.040
Enough.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.440
Out.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:19.960
Wait.

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:24.270
Take this.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.400
The army will be standing by.

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:30.120
I promised Ji Li,

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:32.440
so I wouldn't march on the immortals,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.770
yet guarding against treachery
is necessary.

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:36.230
If Feng Tian

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:38.750
strikes during the talks,

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.480
we must be ready.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.280
Yes.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.080
Who has angered you today?

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.480
Feng Tian

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.240
offered peace,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.480
and my brother agreed!

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.240
Feng Tian's beauty-trap works well:

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:15.000
An immortal beast has Jie Chuan

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.120
dazed and drifting.

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:17.790
If peace is sealed,

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:21.600
your dream of unity will be over.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.870
How ridiculous the oath

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:26.360
you and Jie Chuan once swore!

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.960
Stop sowing discord.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.280
Don't be hasty.

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:35.150
I have a plan.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.600
My soul-devouring aura can stir
the threads of love.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.480
If Jie Chuan truly loves the immortal,

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.120
he'll be unconscious for three days.

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:52.630
Three days are enough

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.320
for you to do whatever you wish.

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:58.510
Yet our clan
still lacks the strength for a war.

00:15:58.510 --> 00:15:59.910
Then let me aid you.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.870
Once the war starts,

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.080
my aura will swallow

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.510
immortal power.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:07.230
Don't worry.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.240
It harms only immortals,

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:11.150
not demons.

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:46.870
This...

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:48.870
Why?

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.000
This matter is grave.

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:16.110
Why not wait

00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:17.830
until the Sovereign wakes up?

00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:21.510
The immortals
must've cast a spell on him,

00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:23.350
so the Sovereign is still asleep.

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:25.890
The chance waits for no one.

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:27.680
We've had the petition.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Stop dithering.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:30.980
By the Sovereign's order:

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.310
the day of peace-talks

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.480
is the day we strike the immortals!

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:37.720
Kill! Kill!

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.580
Kill! Kill!

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.200
Kill! Kill! Kill!

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:51.090
♪Thin wisps of smoke weave

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:58.050
