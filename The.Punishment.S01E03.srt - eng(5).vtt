please calm down.

I have something
to show all the directors.

Yes, Yes.

Chief Zhang Wei
from Gaoxin Police Station.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.510
He is a frontline police officer

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:20.900
and enforces the law impartially.

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.360
He's had me stuck here all night.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.080
Well.

where's that thing?

Here.

Okay.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.230
I'll leave you all to your work then.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:40.280
Director Ye,

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:41.690
take a look at this.

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:45.840
Fortunately, we prepared in advance.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:49.510
I want to have a smoke first.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:50.920
Go ahead. It's fine.

don't be nervous. Take your time.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:53.700
No rush.

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:57.610
With the police backing you up,
what are you afraid of?

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:00.670
Think about it. Think carefully.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:05.000
Police brutality! Forced confession!

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.470
I think we should send someone

to bring this Qian guy back.

If you had evidence,

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.840
why didn't you show it earlier?

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.330
Yes.

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:40.550
I did cause trouble for you.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:42.960
I just wanted an opportunity

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.950
to report to all of you in person.

Director Peng.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.050
Quickly send someone

to bring that Qian guy back.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.850
Okay, I'll call right away.

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.600
Director Peng,
well, Qin Feng, he...

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.200
Hurry up, the leaders are waiting.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:10:59.690
Got it.

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:00.500
Got it.

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:14.550
If you had evidence in your hands,

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:17.350
why didn't you detain him on the spot?

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.640
I couldn't detain him that time.

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:23.090
Actually, I wanted
to give him an opportunity,

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.390
and also give myself

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:28.600
an opportunity to verify my judgment.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.530
What do you mean?

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.560
Explain yourself clearly.

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:33.680
Director Ye.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.170
Well, here is the thing.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:37.480
If we go to the hospital today

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:40.010
and bring back Mr. Qian,

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:43.090
then this whole thing,
at most,

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.920
will be just a case
about violent debt collection.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.520
But if

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:49.550

without a trace,

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:56.900
then the severity of this problem

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.750
becomes completely different.

He's becoming much more calculated
in how he handles things.

"The best defense is a good offense."

You've fallen
right into Hu Xiaoyue's trap.

You think it was you
who drove Hu Xiaoyue to his death?

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.740
No, he just died to make a statement,

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:33.620
so that

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:35.380

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.550
creating a way to get to you.

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:41.400
This matter
is getting bigger and bigger now.

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:44.290
Ye Tianyou has been watching us

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.000
from the outside all these years.

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:48.820
Hu Xiaoyue's suicide

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:50.550
handed him a weapon against us.

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:53.510
We've basically delivered ourselves
to his doorstep.

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:55.720
Mr. Wang, my old friend.

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:58.440
Why do I feel

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.440
you're getting more and more timid?

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:05.030
I'm just being cautious.

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:18.109
Take your time eating. I'm leaving.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:21.920
Come on.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.310
Make way.

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:26.430
Director Ye.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.860
As soon as our people left,

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:30.710
that Qian guy

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:33.160
ran away by using the medical check-up

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:33.990
as an excuse.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.160
We couldn't find him.

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:38.360
We called him,

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:39.710
but couldn't reach him.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.120
Expand the search area.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.130
Send people to keep looking.

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:43.130
You must find him.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:43.730
Okay.

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:44.780
Wait.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.600
You go personally and lead the team.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:48.690
You must bring him back!

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:49.930
Yes, right away.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:50.890
Right away!

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.160
Come on.

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:56.000
Alright.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.170
Everyone return to your units.

00:17:58.890 --> 00:17:59.750

[Detention Room]

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:12.680
Qin Feng.

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:13.230
Here.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.920
You've been on the force a long time.

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:18.690
Administrative authority,

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.110

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:24.240
you know all this.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:25.070
Yes.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.260
Let me tell you,

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.630
if anything happens to this Qian guy,

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:30.720
you'll be held responsible.

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:33.810
Naive.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:37.490
If you keep being so reckless,

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:39.830
you're going to cause serious trouble.

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:41.510
Haven't you
caused enough problems already?

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:42.240
Yes, sir.

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:51.890
Director Peng.

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.350
I'll admit my mistakes first.

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:57.350
I did overstep

00:18:57.810 --> 00:18:59.030
in certain aspects

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.230
of certain cases.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.250
That was wrong of me.

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:06.190
But regarding this incident with Mr. Qian,

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:08.620
before I went there,

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.080
I truly didn't expect him
to act like this.

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:13.270
I never anticipated

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:15.110
that he would go to such extremes

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:16.840
and do something so desperate.

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:19.590
I couldn't arrest him at that moment.

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:21.480
The public was watching.

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:23.360
If I had arrested him on the spot,

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.680
it would have sparked public controversy

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.610
and played right into their hands.

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:31.030
Leaders,

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.570
look, I'm just a station chief.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:35.520
The matters I usually handle

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:37.390
aren't that significant.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.920
But I always feel like

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:43.710
I'm surrounded on all sides.

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:45.600
Look,

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:47.580
this incident today—

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.680
you have all witnessed it.

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:51.040
These people...

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:52.130
To frame me,

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.540
he even dared to jump off a building.

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:55.600
He even had no regard for his own life.

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:57.190
Every day after work,

00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:58.210
I rush home.

00:19:58.510 --> 00:19:59.550
I'm afraid

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:01.960
someone might suddenly appear halfway

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.640
and stab me.

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:05.750
I couldn't handle that, either.

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:10.350
I'm not trying to play the victim here
with you leaders.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:11.620
We have

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:13.940
bloody examples

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:15.360
right in front of us,

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.200
right?

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:17.540
Look, my....

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:18.550
my junior,

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:20.100
Hu Xiaoyue.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.510
He is gone now.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.520
But his case is still pending.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.780
His confidential informant,

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:33.140
to this day,

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.600
is still missing,

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:37.530
his fate unknown.

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:41.180
Hu Xiaoyue was my junior.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.120
I care about his case more than anyone.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.530
I've been staring at this case every day—

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:45.790
watching and waiting—

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.130
only to see that the bureau
hasn't even bothered

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:49.730
to send anyone after that CI.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.470
I just don't understand

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:53.730
why this is happening.

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:56.510
So today, I...

00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:58.740
I'd like to speak

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:01.750
just as a frontline officer

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:04.880
and ask you leaders

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:07.570
for a straight answer:

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.600
What is the case disposition

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.640
of Hu Xiaoyue's case,

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.700
and what is the final determination?

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:18.790
Sit down.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:20.180
Sit.

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:21.110
Yes, sir.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.240
Qin Feng.

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:43.880
This matter has already been reported.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.880
It means the Bureau
has already reached a conclusion.

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:48.600
Isn't that right, Yan?

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:52.330
This conclusion

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:54.760
was determined at our meeting.

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.100
It was likely a suicide case.

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:01.040
I've already reviewed the report.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:03.580
I'll add my signature later.

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:07.480
The conclusion
that Hu Xiaoyue committed suicide

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.790
is legally sound.

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.780
There's nothing more to discuss
about this.

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:14.180
Also,

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:17.510
the CI matter

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.800
Qin Feng just mentioned—

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:21.770
what's going on with that?

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.230
Did you fail to find him,

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:27.630
or did you not even look?

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:29.840
And,

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:32.120
regarding this CI case,

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:33.830
is it being filed separately,

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:35.330
or is it attached to

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.480
Hu Xiaoyue's case?

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:43.450
Director Ye.

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.630
Captain Zhong has reported this to me.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:50.100
It is likely attached

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.710
to Hu Xiaoyue's case.

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:55.180
Attached?

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.510
Then why didn't I see it in the report?

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:08.890
Director Ye,

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:11.000
to be honest,

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.460
with such a major incident in our bureau,

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:17.200
I bear responsibility.

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:19.800
As the supervising leader,

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:22.370
I must reflect on this.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.690
I must conduct
a thorough self-examination.

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:27.560
To be frank with you,

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:31.430
I've barely slept these past few days.

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:33.380
Please rest assured,

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:34.720
after we return,

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.120
we'll immediately hold a meeting,

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.580
file it as a separate case,

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:40.780
and investigate it thoroughly.

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:45.520
Who do you plan
to put in charge of this case?

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:49.140
Regarding the candidate...

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.940
After Hu Xiaoyue's passing,

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.400
his position has remained vacant.

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:09.480
We've been considering
and observing

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:13.280
the officer from
the Criminal Investigation Detachment...

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:15.160
This case is very special.

00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:19.350
I think appointing someone from
within the detachment

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:20.430
is inappropriate.

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:23.590
I suggest appointing someone
from outside.

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:26.550
Director Ye.

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:28.840
Director Ye,

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:30.600
you're a veteran investigator.

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:31.400
You know,

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.860
the criminal investigation work
requires strong expertise.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:37.780
Outsiders are suitable
for administrative work,

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.480
but for investigating cases,
isn't it a bit...

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.400
inappropriate?

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.960
I mean, bringing someone from outside,

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.070
not an amateur.

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:46.640
Qian's disappearance

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.440
is an extremely serious matter.

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.920
We must select someone decisive,

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.620
in their prime,

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.780
with solid professional skills.

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:03.680
Qin Feng.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:04.400
Here.

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:08.770
You've made such a big scene.

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:13.670
Isn't it because you want
to investigate this case yourself?

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:16.220
Director Ye,

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:18.090
I really didn't mean that.

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:19.150
I just...

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.190
I just wanted to find an opportunity

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:23.240
to report

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:25.220
the details I've gathered

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.560
to all the leaders in person.

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.020
I had no other intentions.

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:29.840
You've set up the stage

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:32.790
and put all of us on it.

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:35.250
Now you don't want to perform?

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:37.490
Let me tell you.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.440
Since you've started,
you must finish the show.

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.970
You know better than anyone

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:43.830
that being the First Squad Captain

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:44.940
is very dangerous.

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:46.720
There are traps

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:48.030
and mines

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:50.160
all around them.

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:52.880
One wrong move
and they'll be blown to bits.

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:53.680
That's right.

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:56.870
Who do you think
is suitable for this position?

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.210
Well...

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:02.440
I think this position

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:04.870
carries great responsibility.

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:08.200
After all,

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:09.410
it was previously

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:10.880
Hu Xiaoyue's position.

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.070
He was my junior.

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:14.260
It's not appropriate for me to take it.

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:16.240
But regarding Xiaoyue's case,

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:17.880
I would definitely take it seriously.

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.980
I would spare no effort,

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.590
be completely committed,

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:23.250
and investigate thoroughly.

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:26.880
But I still need
to think about it.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.690
The specific candidate

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:30.440
should be carefully considered

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:31.500
by all the leaders.

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:37.710
The bureau leadership

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.030
is in complete agreement.

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:39.720
Yes, sir.

No, no, no.

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:40.200
Absolutely not.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.460
Isn't this just a trap?

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:44.480
That's not right.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:47.310
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:49.160
If he becomes the First Squad Captain,

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.090
investigating the case
will be much easier,

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:50.610
right?

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:52.200
The investigation will indeed be easier,

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.800
but don't you care
if he gets dragged into this?

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:56.350
If someone has to go, you go yourself.

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:57.590
Well, what are you talking about?

00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:58.510
If I could go,

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:00.640
you two wouldn't
be involved in this at all.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.440
Look, let's not argue

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.830
about whether to go

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:03.310
or not.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:04.820
The point is,
if you want to investigate this,

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:05.830
you have to be there.

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:06.750
How else are you going
to find anything out if you don't go?

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:07.230
No.

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:08.650
Think again.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.800
What is there to think about?

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:13.350
Don't we need
to investigate Xiaoyue's case

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:14.160
thoroughly?

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:15.880
We didn't have the authority
to investigate it before.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.030
Under what capacity
were we supposed to investigate?

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:17.790
Let me tell you this.

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:19.070
I overreached before,

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:20.610
and the leadership
already took issue with it.

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:21.640
If I'm there,

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:24.750
the case will
be thoroughly investigated.

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:25.640
Don't worry.

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:27.160
Well,

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.830
the worst outcome is

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.240
that I get transferred back
to the police station.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.680
And if I can't,

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.100
I'll take your shift instead.

00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:37.770
That makes sense.

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:38.440
Come on.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.740
Just go for it.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:40.940
I've got your back.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.620
Can you two
stop acting so recklessly together?

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:45.720
You know clearly
how many issues

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:46.810
are involved in it.

If he can take you down once,
he can do it again.

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:50.310
This is a fight between big shots.

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:51.680
We can't get involved.

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:53.560
I won't get involved in it.

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:55.270
I couldn't even if I wanted to.

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:57.110
Just taking a look would be fine, right?

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:58.450
Let me find out
which big shot is involved.

00:28:58.450 --> 00:28:59.550
That makes sense.

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:01.320
But,

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:03.350
so what if they're big shots?

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:05.350
These so-called big shots are nothing.

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:07.070
One punch
and they'll be flat on their backs, too.

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:09.000
Why are you picking fights
with the big shots?

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:09.960
That's all I'm saying.

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.270
Mai, Mai, I'm begging you.

Stop stirring things up, will you?

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.960
Anyway, I don't agree with this.

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:17.940
If you really want to go,

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.620
then take me with you.

right?

What would you even be doing there?

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:28.920

ever been separated?

You're being impulsive.

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:39.680
Exactly.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.400
Aren't you afraid of her?

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:45.680

chose this auspicious day.

Look at this place.

This is the center of Han Port.

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:32.590

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:35.270
it will be the economic engine
of the entire Hanzhou,

our Longwan Village will get.

00:31:57.510 --> 00:31:59.920
is to destroy the dignity
of every soul in Longwan.

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.230
You're Bian Jing, right?

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:35.520
Yes.

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:35.880
[Bian Jing, Detective
of the Criminal Investigation Squad]

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:36.400
Nice to meet you, Captain Qin.

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:36.960
Nice to meet you.

[Hanzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau]

00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:39.440
Captain Hu previously

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:40.970
mentioned all of you to me.

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:42.760
You're all

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:44.910
experienced veteran officers.

00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:47.550
We'll be working together from now on.

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:48.810
Let's cooperate well.

00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:51.550
Bian Jing, I heard you were

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.110
trained by

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:54.660
Captain Zhong, right?

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:55.230
Yes.

00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:57.010
That's impressive.

00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:58.850
A great teacher
produces a brilliant student.

00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:00.980
Let's communicate more in the future.

00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:03.030
Nice to meet you. I'm Wang Tao.

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:05.210
I've been working
with Captain Qin at the grassroots level.

00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:06.610
I hope I can count on your support.

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:07.290
Good. Welcome.

00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:08.300
Welcome.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:10.880
This is a bit much, isn't it?

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:11.940
Well, Captain Qin.

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:14.880
These are some cases
that Captain Hu was handling.

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:16.920
Which one would you like to start with?

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:18.680
Just leave them there for now.

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:20.480
I'll look at them gradually.

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:21.710
I just got here.

00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:24.230
I should check in with the leader, right?

00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:27.400
For future work arrangements and duties,

00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:29.190
I need to follow
the leader's instructions,

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:29.800
right?

00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:30.760
Captain Qin,

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:33.440
after what happened to Captain Hu,

00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:36.550
we all felt pretty lost.

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:38.120
Now that you're here,

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.400
we feel much more at ease.

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:41.980
Please don't say that.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.320
I'm only here

00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:45.880
to finish

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.540
my junior's shift,

00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:48.230
right?

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:49.190
That's all there is to it.

00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:50.110
Captain Qin,

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:51.920
we all wanted to attend

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:53.190
Captain Hu's funeral,

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:55.970
but Captain Zhong said
it might not look good.

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:57.250
Don't talk nonsense.

00:42:57.250 --> 00:42:58.590
He didn't mean that.

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:02.850
He surely had his considerations.

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:04.550
Let's not talk about this anymore.

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:05.320
You know,

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:09.000
you shouldn't randomly guess
what the leaders are thinking, understand?

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:09.590
Well.

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.190
Which desk did Xiaoyue use before?

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:14.620
This one. I've cleaned it for you.

00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:17.000
-Tao, this is your desk.
-Thank you. Thank you.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:17.840
Thank you.
