00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:53.439
Fifth Princess

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:01.879
Don't move.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.120
The Fifth Princess is so obedient.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.360
What if A Lan disobeys?

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.879
Disobey?

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.560
Then it's a dead end.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.439
Eldest Cousin will teach you archery.

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:03.080
Hurry up.

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:32.599
Prince Ning's token.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.400
You scared away my rabbit.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.400
This will come at a price.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.280
Eldest Cousin...

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.280
A Lan wouldn't dare.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.280
Don't be afraid.

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:03.879
Just pretend it's a rabbit.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.160
I'll go check.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.959
What are you doing here?

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:53.360
People sent by Prince Ning.

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:57.920
I sensed movement from Prince Ning's faction.

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:59.240
I came specifically to investigate.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.680
Unexpectedly, I ended up saving your life, Lord Zhang.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.360
You would be so kind?

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.240
I am certainly not a kind-hearted person.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.040
The black-clad men will catch up soon.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.600
Lord Zhang should worry about himself.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.680
What will it take for you to save me?

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:20.079
That depends on what Lord Zhang offers me.

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:26.879
Wait.

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:30.199
Wait.

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:40.680
The assassin who infiltrated the Benevolent Heart Hall is named Shadowless.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.120
He was sent by Prince Ning.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.439
Prince Ning sent someone into the Benevolent Heart Hall

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.279
to steal the Map of the Nine Provinces.

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:50.360
On the fifteenth of this month,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.639
Prince Ning will secretly meet

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.839
with Shadowless at the Flying Immortal Pavilion.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.040
At that time,

00:06:00.079 --> 00:06:00.639
Lord Zhang...

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.120
Come.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.759
Yes, yes.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.439
It was Prince Ning who poisoned me.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.720
In return for all I've told you,

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.560
I beg you to send my wife and child

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.079
back to Danzhou.

00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:38.160
One more thing.

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:42.399
Back then, your... your father...

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.639
Your... your mother...

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:09.360
Bury him.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.759
E-Eldest Cousin...

00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:25.879
D-Did I hit it?

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.959
Did the Fifth Princess enjoy herself?

00:07:42.439 --> 00:07:43.439
Good that she's happy.

00:07:51.439 --> 00:07:53.240
He really did discover I was pretending to be foolish.

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:55.279
The outing was a pretense.

00:07:55.759 --> 00:07:57.480
Ambushing Lord Zhang, and warning me in passing,

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.519
was his true purpose.

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:00.680
This man is cunning and treacherous.

00:08:01.079 --> 00:08:03.079
Stay as far away from him as possible.

00:08:24.319 --> 00:08:25.079
You've come.

00:08:26.079 --> 00:08:27.600
The Map of the Nine Provinces is not in the palace.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.839
It might be in the Meng residence.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.039
You can send someone to investigate.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.919
How do you know the map is at the Meng residence?

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.559
Your Highness and I are grasshoppers tied to the same string.

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:39.919
There's no need for Your Highness to doubt me.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.120
It's not that I don't trust you.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.039
Commander He!

00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:12.919
Something terrible!

00:09:13.039 --> 00:09:13.960
The Princess is missing!

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:14.559
What?!

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.720
Leave no place in the palace unchecked.

00:09:24.559 --> 00:09:25.840
We must find the Fifth Princess quickly.

00:09:26.759 --> 00:09:27.240
Alright.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.080
Go quickly.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:28.879
Yes.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.080
This servant deserves death.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:47.639
This servant deserves death.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.840
Is Your Excellency looking for the Fifth Princess?

00:09:50.559 --> 00:09:51.440
This servant just saw

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.080
the Fifth Princess heading towards the Cold Palace.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.039
You may leave.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:24.679
Princess, are you alright?

00:11:24.679 --> 00:11:25.360
I'm fine, I'm fine.

00:11:26.879 --> 00:11:27.320
Princess...

00:11:27.799 --> 00:11:29.679
Why are we trapping Commander He?

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:32.840
Trust me.

00:11:33.759 --> 00:11:34.720
The less you know,

00:11:35.159 --> 00:11:36.000
the better for you.

00:11:43.399 --> 00:11:44.080
That's...

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.759
Tonight at Xu hour, Luo Jie River, Flying Immortal Pavilion.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.039
Have you found Commander He?

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:52.679
No.

00:11:52.759 --> 00:11:53.360
Keep looking.

00:11:54.519 --> 00:11:55.279
Commander He...

00:11:55.679 --> 00:11:56.360
Don't blame me.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.480
I'm doing this all to save you.

00:12:08.039 --> 00:12:08.639
Princess...

00:12:09.519 --> 00:12:12.600
Do you think that dry well can hold Commander He?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:13.720
Of course it can.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:14.720
Don't forget,

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.120
the huge rock on that well

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.159
was moved by the three of us

00:12:17.279 --> 00:12:18.759
using all our strength.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.159
Even if the rock is moved,

00:12:31.399 --> 00:12:33.080
Commander He is also under a special sedative.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.759
Unless he receives some major shock,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:36.480
otherwise,

00:12:36.679 --> 00:12:38.679
he'll be unconscious for at least a day and night.

00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:39.919
Rest assured.

00:13:03.639 --> 00:13:05.799
A Lan used to love grapes this much too.

00:13:07.039 --> 00:13:07.639
I don't like them.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:08.600
I hate them.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.759
Lost her mind.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Like she became a different person.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:18.919
Becoming someone else is fine.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.279
The way she is now

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.279
is much more pleasing to the eye.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.159
The little fool is here again, mooching food off A Zi.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:31.799
Mosquito!

00:13:33.879 --> 00:13:35.360
Trying that trick again? I...

00:13:35.559 --> 00:13:36.399
Fourth Sister!

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:37.519
Seventh Cousin!

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.080
Did you come today to see Her Majesty the Empress?

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.000
Yes.

00:13:41.159 --> 00:13:42.960
Her Majesty wanted delicacies from the Gourmet Pavilion.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:43.799
So I brought some over.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:44.759
By the way,

00:13:45.159 --> 00:13:46.919
there are fireworks at Luo Jie River tonight.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.320
I'll take you both to see them.

00:13:50.799 --> 00:13:51.679
A Lan won't go.

00:13:52.159 --> 00:13:54.159
Fourth Sister and Seventh Cousin should go.

00:13:57.039 --> 00:13:57.399
You...

00:14:02.799 --> 00:14:03.960
Even in ancient times,

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.039
being a third wheel is no good.

00:14:31.879 --> 00:14:32.519
Fifth Princess!

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:38.639
What's going on?

00:14:39.159 --> 00:14:41.000
Wasn't she supposed to be unconscious for a day and night?

00:14:42.159 --> 00:14:42.720
This servant...

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:43.960
This servant doesn't know either.

00:14:46.679 --> 00:14:47.720
Where was the Fifth Princess found?

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.960
She was found at the Fourth Princess's place.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.600
It scared this maid half to death.

00:14:54.039 --> 00:14:57.159
This maid... this maid forgot to inform you, sir.

00:14:57.799 --> 00:14:59.080
Please forgive this offense, sir.

00:15:01.879 --> 00:15:02.480
It's good that she's found.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.919
I need to leave the palace shortly.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.519
I shall take my leave now.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.399
Princess, how...

00:15:19.559 --> 00:15:20.879
A Zi, please go.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.039
The fireworks at Luo Jie River

00:15:22.039 --> 00:15:23.320
aren't something you can see anytime.

00:15:25.879 --> 00:15:27.519
Just think of it as accompanying me, okay?

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:31.639
Fourth Sister.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.440
A Lan wants to leave the palace too.

00:15:33.799 --> 00:15:35.519
To... to see the fireworks.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:47.440
Alright, alright.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:48.639
Look there, look there!

00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:51.519
Isn't it much livelier than the palace?

00:15:54.559 --> 00:15:55.279
Fourth Sister.

00:15:55.559 --> 00:15:57.200
A Lan wants to go see the fireworks.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:57.720
Fine.

00:15:57.919 --> 00:15:58.879
Let's go now.

00:16:02.279 --> 00:16:02.840
Thief!

00:16:04.559 --> 00:16:05.320
My money pouch was stolen!

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:08.559
Protect A Lan.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:17.559
Ru Feng.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:18.720
Ru Feng!

00:16:19.559 --> 00:16:20.240
Young Master Xiu.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:21.080
Ru Feng.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.399
You take A Lan to Luo Jie River.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.279
I'll go check on A Zi.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:24.120
Keep a close eye on her.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:25.759
Young Master Xiu.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.440
Understood.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:36.879
Come take a look at masks!

00:16:37.639 --> 00:16:38.039
Miss.

00:16:38.759 --> 00:16:39.320
Here's your money.

00:16:59.159 --> 00:17:00.399
The scenery from our boat ride earlier

00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:01.720
really had a unique charm to it.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:02.679
Let's come again next time.

00:17:03.639 --> 00:17:04.400
It's Young Master Meng!

00:17:04.759 --> 00:17:05.519
Young Master Meng.

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:07.240
Young Master Meng is coming over.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Who is this Young Master Meng?

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.880
You're new to the capital, so of course you don't know.

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:18.640
He's the leader of the Four Young Masters of Yunmi.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:19.880
The son of Grand Preceptor Meng.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:20.720
He's also Yunmi's

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.240
first Top Scholar in Arts and Arms.

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:24.799
The dream lover of countless women.

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:26.720
If I could marry Young Master Meng,

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:28.599
I'd willingly be vegetarian for ten years.

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:29.440
I'd do twenty years!

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.319
I'd do thirty!

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.640
How can he be so handsome?

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:33.319
Indeed.

00:17:33.319 --> 00:17:34.599
How can one win him over?

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.160
Young Master Meng!

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.640
Young Master Meng, you're so handsome!

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.279
Young Master Meng! Young Master Meng!

00:17:50.559 --> 00:17:51.640
Has anyone here seen

00:17:52.039 --> 00:17:53.599
a small pig, completely black in color?

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.079
Come on, come on, let's drink!

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:40.920
Why is he here?

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:47.920
Fifth Princess.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.680
Later, the two of you will lie in wait outside the room.

00:18:51.519 --> 00:18:52.240
I'll hide inside.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.400
Once the assassin and the person behind him meet,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:55.839
we'll coordinate from inside and out

00:18:56.279 --> 00:18:57.279
and move to capture them.

00:18:58.039 --> 00:18:58.519
Yes.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.880
Could Yuwen Rui have recognized me?

00:19:07.559 --> 00:19:08.480
Second floor of the Flying Immortal Pavilion.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.119
Aren't dancing girls not allowed in here?

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:12.960
My lord, forgive me.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.079
This humble girl took a wrong turn.

00:19:52.319 --> 00:19:53.119
Master.

00:19:55.599 --> 00:19:56.839
You're so naughty.

00:20:30.279 --> 00:20:32.160
The magistrate's office is quite a distance from Luo Jie River.

00:20:32.759 --> 00:20:34.400
Going there and back will waste a lot of time.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.160
Is A Lan waiting for us?

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:38.680
I've already told Ru Feng

00:20:38.839 --> 00:20:40.200
to take A Lan to Luo Jie River to see the fireworks.

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.160
Pity you won't get to see the fireworks this time.

00:20:52.319 --> 00:20:54.400
I didn't expect fireworks here too.

00:20:56.319 --> 00:20:56.839
A Zi, look!

00:20:57.599 --> 00:20:58.319
Isn't it beautiful?

00:21:10.599 --> 00:21:11.200
A Zi, look!

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.039
That purple one is especially pretty.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:52.960
The young master said

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:53.920
whoever finds Little Black

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:54.720
gets a reward of one thousand taels.

00:21:55.119 --> 00:21:55.599
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

00:21:55.599 --> 00:21:57.279
Someone saw Little Black heading towards the Flying Immortal Pavilion.

00:21:59.039 --> 00:21:59.799
What are you looking for?

00:21:59.799 --> 00:22:00.480
Little Black.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.200
What exactly is Little Black?

00:22:02.559 --> 00:22:03.400
People from the Meng residence.

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:10.640
Just in case.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:11.599
Spread the word.

00:22:12.279 --> 00:22:13.920
Have Shadowless come to the Flying Immortal Pavilion

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.160
and find me at the Jingshui Tower opposite.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:16.039
Yes.

00:22:23.039 --> 00:22:24.599
Just now, this humble girl was flustered in the moment

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.160
and thus offended you, my lord.

00:22:26.599 --> 00:22:27.759
I hope you can be magnanimous.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.599
Then I won't disturb you any further, my lord.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.839
This humble girl will take her leave.

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:36.079
Halt.

00:22:43.559 --> 00:22:44.839
Does my lord have any other instructions?

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:50.599
Take it away.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.640
This humble girl doesn't know how to take it away either.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.119
Perhaps I should go out and look for

00:22:56.119 --> 00:22:57.000
this pig's owner

00:22:57.319 --> 00:22:59.319
and have him come take this little black pig away,

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.519
and also kowtow to apologize to you, my lord.

00:23:18.039 --> 00:23:19.880
The Grand Chancellor is ruthless and vicious.

00:23:20.599 --> 00:23:22.480
Won't you even spare a little black pig?

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.119
If Young Master Meng dares to offend this official,

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.720
this official will likewise not let it go.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.960
A lone man and woman alone in a room.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.119
You're in high spirits, my lord.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.079
So it was you who just said

00:23:54.279 --> 00:23:55.839
to find me to come kowtow and apologize?

00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.759
Which family's young lady

00:24:01.599 --> 00:24:03.480
is so good at pleasing the Grand Chancellor?

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.920
Young Master Meng, are you trying, in front of me,

00:24:10.359 --> 00:24:11.519
to bully my person?

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.119
The Grand Chancellor seems to have urgent business to attend to.

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.559
I won't keep you company any longer.

00:26:25.279 --> 00:26:26.079
They want to kill He Lianchen.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:27.400
Eldest Cousin!

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:27.960
There's danger!

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:28.839
Hide!

00:26:31.519 --> 00:26:31.960
Let go!

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.359
No! There's danger!

00:26:33.599 --> 00:26:34.440
Hide with A Lan!

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:42.400
It's not about killing He Lianchen.

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:44.359
Speak quickly!

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.119
Who sent you to infiltrate the imperial palace?

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:56.720
Won't talk, huh?

00:27:04.039 --> 00:27:04.720
Watch out!

00:27:16.519 --> 00:27:17.240
It's poisoned!

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:28.400
Think of something!

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.119
Yeah!

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:30.640
Eldest Cousin!

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.920
Commander He has been poisoned and fallen into the water!

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:39.759
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.119
This Luo Jie River looks narrow,

00:27:41.319 --> 00:27:42.119
but the water is very deep!

00:27:42.359 --> 00:27:42.880
That's right.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.960
And there are underground rivers beneath the water.

00:27:48.279 --> 00:27:49.240
Why hasn't he come up yet?

00:28:01.519 --> 00:28:02.599
Commander He's belt!

00:28:23.079 --> 00:28:24.400
Why did that girl jump in?

00:28:50.039 --> 00:28:51.480
They're jumping in one after another!

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.680
Why did this girl tie a rope and jump into the water?

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.559
She saw the Grand Chancellor hadn't come out.

00:29:03.759 --> 00:29:05.160
So she anxiously jumped in to save him.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.519
Grand Chancellor, this worried look of yours...

00:29:06.599 --> 00:29:08.000
...clearly shows she admires the Grand Chancellor.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:08.960
What a devoted girl.

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.119
What did the girl who fell in look like?

00:29:11.559 --> 00:29:12.880
She was wearing a pink gauze dress.

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:13.680
She called...

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.519
...called the Grand Chancellor 'Eldest Cousin'.

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:16.440
Yes, 'Eldest Cousin'.

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.000
What?
