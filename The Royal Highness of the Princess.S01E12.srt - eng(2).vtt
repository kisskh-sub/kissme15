00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.599
Fifth Princess

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.760
When the master is sleeping,

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:48.599
he absolutely must not be

00:01:51.519 --> 00:01:53.239
disturbed.

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:05.599
Cousin.

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:06.640
Good morning.

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:19.319
What are you doing here?

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.879
I'm here to help you, Cousin, get up and wash.

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:24.039
Would you like something to drink, Cousin?

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:26.639
We have green tea,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.400
warm water,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.439
and grape juice.

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.639
So, Cousin, what would you like to drink?

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.800
Warm water.

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:41.080
Alright.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.680
Cousin,

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:25.120
let me help you get dressed.

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:27.080
Did no one tell you

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:28.560
that what I dislike most

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.960
is being disturbed while I sleep?

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.520
That's my fault.

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:33.840
I'll come back later then.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.400
Get straight to the point.

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:43.840
Cousin,

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:45.199
could you be a bit gentler?

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.639
It really hurts.

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:58.439
The master, he actually...

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:02.360
It seems the master

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.039
has taken a liking to the Fifth Princess.

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:05.199
Master,

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:07.039
you've hidden it so well.

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:08.439
What's wrong with the master?

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.959
Is our princess inside?

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:28.519
I heard

00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:30.759
the master dislikes being disturbed while sleeping.

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:32.279
He wouldn't be inside

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:33.560
bullying our princess, would he?

00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:37.800
Well, if you mean bu-bullying,

00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:39.759
then I suppose so.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.720
Don't worry,

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.399
the Fifth Princess will be fine.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.120
Really.

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:51.319
Really.

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:56.279
Dislikes being disturbed while sleeping,

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:03.920
and even made you wear...

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.879
Your master certainly has a lot of quirks.

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:11.120
All these years,

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.199
being by his side,

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.759
must have been tough.

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:18.800
I-I've gotten used to it.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.480
I'll go get your breakfast first.

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:33.480
I'll be right back.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.560
Princess, are you alright?

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.879
What could possibly be wrong with me?

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:53.040
This business of Young Master Meng frantically looking for the Fifth Princess...

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.240
I'd better not tell her yet.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.839
Others can read ten lines at a glance,

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:10.439
but the master reads ten pages at a glance.

00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:31.600
Cousin is bathing.

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:33.240
You follow him even when he bathes?

00:07:33.519 --> 00:07:34.240
Of course.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.199
I must be a loyal,

00:07:37.319 --> 00:07:39.720
attentive, and capable personal maid.

00:07:44.079 --> 00:07:45.959
What I want isn't just a maid.

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:48.000
What else do you want, Cousin?

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.680
As long as I can do it,

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.319
I'll definitely help you.

00:07:50.959 --> 00:07:51.839
What do you mean?

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:52.759
I've been a maid

00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:54.360
at the Meng Mansion for a while now.

00:07:57.879 --> 00:07:59.079
You'll find out later.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.680
We'll talk about that later.

00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:04.120
For now, let me have you try

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.040
my new invention.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.839
I guarantee after using it,

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.240
you'll be reborn,

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:10.240
given a new lease on life.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:14.839
That's completely unnecessary.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.639
You say the master's skin,

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.959
how is it so delicate and smooth?

00:08:22.279 --> 00:08:23.879
It's as silky as...

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.519
As what?

00:08:31.439 --> 00:08:32.000
I retract that.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.279
Let's start over.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.159
The master's skin, you see,

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.639
is truly silky where it should be silky,

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.879
and rough where it should be rough.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.759
Why is you men's skin

00:08:44.759 --> 00:08:45.600
so perfect?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:49.720
You...

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.600
Has Meng Shaojue used this invention of yours?

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.720
Why so quiet?

00:09:01.679 --> 00:09:03.399
H-how could that be?

00:09:03.919 --> 00:09:05.399
Such a great invention

00:09:05.759 --> 00:09:08.120
naturally must be used by you first, Master.

00:09:08.679 --> 00:09:09.600
Stop being sarcastic.

00:09:10.879 --> 00:09:11.240
Speak.

00:09:11.639 --> 00:09:12.360
What's your purpose?

00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:15.960
What purpose could I possibly have?

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.399
I'm just here to promote bath-scrubbing culture.

00:09:19.759 --> 00:09:20.639
Speak plainly.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.159
There is indeed a small favor I need from you, Master.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:32.559
Let's hear it.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.759
I want you to lend me Ru Feng for a few days.

00:09:37.799 --> 00:09:39.440
I want him to, from morning till night,

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.799
guard me, protect me.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.080
Coincidentally, I've been missing Meng Yinglu these past two days.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.279
I plan to visit her in a couple of days.

00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:46.720
Ru Feng can accompany me down the mountain.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.639
There are people protecting you in the shadows.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.039
The matter of going down the mountain

00:09:52.039 --> 00:09:53.279
can wait until I return from the palace.

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:55.080
I know there are people in the shadows monit-

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.879
protecting me.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.559
But I need protection in the open too.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:09:59.720
In this villa,

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:00.519
aside from you,

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.159
he has the highest martial arts skill.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:03.879
I can't possibly have you

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.519
guarding me day and night, can I?

00:10:06.039 --> 00:10:06.879
Even if I wanted to,

00:10:07.679 --> 00:10:08.879
you certainly wouldn't be willing.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.039
So, what do you say?

00:10:16.279 --> 00:10:16.960
Turn around.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.360
So it's settled about Ru Feng, okay?

00:10:44.159 --> 00:10:46.240
Agree or not, at least say something!

00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:56.080
Are you done?

00:10:56.919 --> 00:10:57.720
I'm turning around now.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:06.919
You...

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.720
Put your clothes on properly.

00:11:13.679 --> 00:11:15.559
What are you... what are you doing?

00:11:30.559 --> 00:11:31.399
I'm getting dressed.

00:11:31.919 --> 00:11:32.840
Why is your face red?

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.159
I am not.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.799
Isn't this the Auspicious Knot

00:11:47.799 --> 00:11:49.039
I bought for you at Peiyu Pavilion?

00:11:54.279 --> 00:11:56.840
You don't carry it with you every day, do you?

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.080
You actually keep it on your person.

00:11:59.399 --> 00:12:00.919
Right over your heart, no less.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.720
Don't tell me...

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.600
You discovered this Auspicious Knot is actually very valuable?

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:10.960
Right?

00:12:12.679 --> 00:12:13.600
What a miscalculation.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.039
Back then, I actually thought it was a fake.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.200
Had I known, I shouldn't have given it to you.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.240
Wait a minute!

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.480
You haven't agreed to my request about Ru Feng yet.

00:12:24.679 --> 00:12:25.360
We'll talk about it when I get back.

00:12:29.679 --> 00:12:30.080
My lord.

00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:31.960
Our people watching Prince Ning's mansion have sent word.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.759
Prince Ning has closed his doors and refuses visitors.

00:12:34.039 --> 00:12:35.519
He has also secretly summoned several physicians.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.159
It seems the poison has taken effect.

00:12:39.159 --> 00:12:39.759
Starting today,

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.399
you will stay by the Fifth Princess's side.

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:43.279
Rest assured, my lord.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.120
This subordinate will spare no effort

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:45.960
to protect the Fifth Princess.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.759
Your humble servant pays respects to Your Majesty.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.799
May I ask why Your Majesty urgently summoned me to the palace?

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:12.960
What is the matter?

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.159
Prince Ning is injured.

00:13:20.519 --> 00:13:22.279
He accidentally scalded himself yesterday.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.840
Then let Imperial Physician Chen examine you.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.600
Thank you for Your Majesty's concern.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.759
It's just a minor injury.

00:13:31.559 --> 00:13:33.639
Prince Ning has dedicated himself to Yunmi.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.519
It is only right for me

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:36.960
to be concerned about your health.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:41.559
Yes.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:12.559
Your Majesty can rest assured.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.360
Prince Ning's scald is not very serious.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.279
Applying Yuqing Ointment for a few days will suffice.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.039
That is good to hear.

00:14:20.679 --> 00:14:23.360
Prince Ning must still take more care of his health.

00:14:26.919 --> 00:14:28.159
Thank you for Your Majesty's concern.

00:14:44.799 --> 00:14:45.759
Trying to please him is useless.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.360
Why is Yuwen Rui harder to deal with than Xiao Hei?

00:14:49.799 --> 00:14:52.600
Maybe I should think of a way to kidnap Ru Feng.

00:14:53.759 --> 00:14:55.279
But his martial arts are quite formidable.

00:14:57.039 --> 00:14:59.440
Can't use force, must rely on wit.

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:00.960
Fifth Princess.

00:15:02.039 --> 00:15:03.080
Why do you want to kidnap me?

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:05.679
It's nothing.

00:15:06.279 --> 00:15:07.559
I wanted to ask you about something.

00:15:09.519 --> 00:15:10.879
Why aren't you following Yuwen Rui?

00:15:11.919 --> 00:15:13.080
Before he left, my lord gave orders.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.080
He told me to follow the Fifth Princess's commands from now on.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.000
Yuwen Rui does have a conscience.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.000
Starting today,

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.120
you must stay within my line of sight.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.000
Understood?

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:26.360
Fifth Princess,

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:28.279
what did you want to ask me about?

00:15:28.279 --> 00:15:29.080
You can just ask me directly.

00:15:35.559 --> 00:15:37.879
Do you know how Yuwen Rui

00:15:37.879 --> 00:15:38.679
got the scars on his back?

00:15:39.279 --> 00:15:40.960
The Fifth Princess even knows about that?

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.120
My lord and the princess really are...

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:45.480
Fifth Princess,

00:15:45.759 --> 00:15:46.960
I hope you won't take it to heart.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:48.200
Wait a minute.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:49.840
Take it to heart?

00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:51.480
What would I take to heart?

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:52.639
Well...

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.240
Indeed, there's nothing to take to heart.

00:15:54.639 --> 00:15:56.120
The Fifth Princess really is different from before.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:57.480
If my lord knew,

00:15:57.679 --> 00:15:58.759
he would be deeply moved.

00:15:59.039 --> 00:16:00.440
What nonsense is this?

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.799
Are the thought processes of you maids and guards

00:16:02.799 --> 00:16:04.039
all this strange?

00:16:05.159 --> 00:16:05.759
Forget it, forget it.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.639
Tell me about the scars on Yuwen Rui's back.

00:16:10.879 --> 00:16:13.759
After the old general and his wife passed away,

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.080
my lord took up his spear and went to the battlefield.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.000
He fought everywhere to protect our Yunmi.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.120
All these years,

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.320
amidst the clash of blades and rain of blood,

00:16:20.879 --> 00:16:21.559
it was inevitable he'd sustain some injuries.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.159
Princess,

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.919
you must treat our lord well from now on.

00:16:27.039 --> 00:16:28.600
Me, treat him well?

00:16:30.879 --> 00:16:31.840
When my lord was young,

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.639
the old general and his wife passed away.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.159
For all these years,

00:16:35.879 --> 00:16:37.399
my lord has been on his own.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.799
When did you first meet Yuwen Rui?

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:42.840
Eight years ago.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.559
Back then, the Yun-Zhan War...

00:16:45.559 --> 00:16:47.080
In order to seize the Map of the Nine Provinces,

00:16:47.559 --> 00:16:48.279
they rashly dispatched troops.

00:16:49.039 --> 00:16:51.720
My hometown was right on the border between the two countries.

00:16:52.759 --> 00:16:54.840
The flames of war burned the entire village.

00:16:55.639 --> 00:16:56.279
It was my lord

00:16:56.919 --> 00:16:58.720
who rescued me from the raging flames.

00:16:59.159 --> 00:17:00.120
Of the whole village,

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.240
I was the only one who survived.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.039
Ever since then,

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.559
you've been following Yuwen Rui.

00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:08.559
I was only twelve years old then.

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:10.039
My lord thought I was too young,

00:17:10.559 --> 00:17:12.079
that I'd only be a hindrance on the battlefield.

00:17:12.559 --> 00:17:13.759
So I followed them for many days.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.440
I practiced swordplay day and night.

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:16.519
After I was discovered,

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.200
that's when I finally entered my lord's service.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.640
No wonder you're so loyal to him.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:22.880
You obey him in everything.

00:17:23.279 --> 00:17:25.000
My lord is worthy of it.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.799
Yuwen Rui saved you,

00:17:30.519 --> 00:17:32.359
not so you could blindly repay the favor.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:33.640
Otherwise,

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.200
there was no need to drive you away at first.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:36.599
I know.

00:17:37.359 --> 00:17:39.200
It's right for you to repay his life-saving grace.

00:17:39.799 --> 00:17:41.680
But you can't just be a pawn.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:44.240
A pawn?

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.200
What does that mean?

00:17:46.839 --> 00:17:47.839
It means,

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.039
besides repaying the favor,

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.559
you should also have your own life.

00:17:50.759 --> 00:17:51.839
You need to have things you want to do.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.720
You can't have your head filled with thoughts like,

00:17:53.839 --> 00:17:54.640
"You saved me,

00:17:55.039 --> 00:17:56.079
so my life is yours.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.359
I'll do whatever you tell me to do."

00:17:59.039 --> 00:18:00.319
Fifth Princess, how did you know?

00:18:00.839 --> 00:18:01.559
From that day on,

00:18:01.759 --> 00:18:02.359
I swore an oath

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.640
to obey my lord's every command thereafter.

00:18:05.839 --> 00:18:07.440
That's how it always is in TV dramas.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.240
I'm not trying to drive a wedge

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.480
between you and Yuwen Rui.

00:18:11.759 --> 00:18:12.799
It's just that, when you're alive,

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.559
you need to have hopes, big or small.

00:18:14.839 --> 00:18:15.359
Do you understand?

00:18:22.319 --> 00:18:22.960
Princess,

00:18:23.279 --> 00:18:24.559
this servant has brought you grapes.

00:18:25.839 --> 00:18:27.519
Then this subordinate will take his leave.

00:18:33.799 --> 00:18:35.599
Today's grapes are really fresh.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.799
Princess, try one quickly.

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:44.839
Just now at the Benevolent Heart Hall

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.200
Eldest Cousin saw Third Imperial Uncle's wrist bandaged

00:18:48.759 --> 00:18:49.400
and wasn't surprised.

00:18:50.519 --> 00:18:52.039
You suspected him of stealing the map long ago.

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.720
Third Imperial Uncle has long been called a Living Bodhisattva.

00:18:57.279 --> 00:18:58.319
He has Father Emperor's deep trust.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.440
Why would Eldest Cousin suspect him?

00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:08.720
The more sinister and vicious a person is,

00:19:09.559 --> 00:19:10.559
the more they like to hide behind

00:19:10.559 --> 00:19:12.920
the name of a Living Bodhisattva to do evil.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.440
If what you say is true,

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.400
and Third Imperial Uncle really stole the fake map from Meng Mansion,

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.279
why wasn't he poisoned?

00:19:22.079 --> 00:19:24.160
Don't you have the only antidote?

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.039
The antidote was at the suburban villa.

00:19:28.079 --> 00:19:28.920
It might have been stolen.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:31.559
I'll go with you to check.

00:19:32.559 --> 00:19:33.000
A Zi.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.839
I brought you delicacies from Zhenxiu Pavilion.

00:19:43.759 --> 00:19:44.640
Seventh Cousin, please don't

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.839
bring me food from outside the palace anymore.

00:19:48.839 --> 00:19:49.839
I know you care about me.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:51.279
But now,

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.279
you have a woman you like.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:55.279
If she were to find out,

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:56.799
it would inevitably cause misunderstanding.

00:19:58.279 --> 00:19:59.920
I will also keep my distance from you from now on.

00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:05.000
Let's go, Eldest Cousin.

00:20:15.039 --> 00:20:15.480
Zixiu.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.519
Don't make yourself regret it.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:22.759
Elder Brother.

00:20:23.839 --> 00:20:24.960
I am just a

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.480
good-for-nothing playboy.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.519
I'm not worthy of A Zi.

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.279
That's not a reason.

00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:47.680
Slow down.

00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:54.319
Where are you rushing off to, My Lord?

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.480
Speak plainly, Young Master Meng.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.240
Did you take A Lan away?

00:21:00.039 --> 00:21:00.799
What if I did?

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.839
Lord Yuwen should know

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.000
she is a member of my Meng Mansion.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:07.480
Is that so?

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:11.400
Young Master.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.519
I investigated the people around Yuwen Rui.

00:21:13.799 --> 00:21:14.839
I found a portrait of the Fifth Princess.

00:21:33.559 --> 00:21:34.440
Don't forget, Young Master Meng,

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.640
she and I are betrothed.

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:38.920
But I've heard news

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.079
that A Lan is not satisfied with this betrothal.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:42.839
As long as she doesn't want it,

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.039
I will never let anyone force her.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.799
There are some people you shouldn't covet.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:50.799
What if I do?

00:21:52.799 --> 00:21:53.480
We'll see.

00:21:58.079 --> 00:21:58.839
A Lan told me

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.319
she left a letter for you.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.359
Didn't Young Master Meng see it?

00:22:05.079 --> 00:22:06.200
A Lan is safe now.

00:22:06.839 --> 00:22:07.920
There's no need for Young Master Meng to worry.

00:22:08.559 --> 00:22:09.519
Her identity is special.

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:10.839
The matter of her being in your mansion,

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.079
please do not leak it, Young Master Meng.

00:22:29.319 --> 00:22:29.839
Xixi.

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.319
Do you know how the old general and his wife

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:33.519
passed away?

00:22:35.039 --> 00:22:36.839
This servant heard people in the palace say

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:40.319
that when the old general and Lady Shen went to battle,

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:41.920
they were ambushed

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:42.720
and died unfortunately.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.720
It's a pity. They spent their whole lives guarding Yunmi,

00:22:48.079 --> 00:22:50.720
yet couldn't see the current peaceful age.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:53.920
Princess.

00:22:54.799 --> 00:22:55.319
Rest for a while.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.920
I've prepared chilled watermelon for you.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:57.559
Alright.

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.000
The Princess likes to eat grapes.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.079
Why did you prepare watermelon?

00:23:06.559 --> 00:23:07.119
It's fine.

00:23:07.319 --> 00:23:09.160
It's nice to eat melon occasionally.

00:23:09.559 --> 00:23:10.160
Xixi.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.559
Didn't you say you wanted watermelon this morning?

00:23:12.839 --> 00:23:13.279
Here,

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:13.960
have a taste.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.519
Princess, you eat first.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.400
This servant still needs to water these potted plants.

00:23:20.079 --> 00:23:21.079
You go and rest with the Princess.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.160
I'll take care of this here.

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:22.960
No need.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:23.720
I'll be done soon.

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:24.680
Then I'll help you.

00:23:40.279 --> 00:23:42.119
Any more water and they'll drown.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.240
Fifth Princess, I...

00:23:51.319 --> 00:23:51.759
My Lord.

00:23:57.079 --> 00:23:57.920
I heard from Ru Feng

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.440
you entered the palace regarding Prince Ning's matter.

00:23:59.799 --> 00:24:00.319
How did it go?

00:24:06.279 --> 00:24:07.160
Prince Ning wasn't poisoned.

00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:10.200
Eldest Cousin suspects the antidote was stolen.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:38.920
The antidote really was stolen.

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.480
Someone who can evade the hidden guards

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.279
and silently steal the antidote

00:24:44.279 --> 00:24:45.519
from my villa

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.680
can be counted on one hand in Yunmi.

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:49.319
Around Prince Ning,

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.839
there is no person of such skill.

00:24:51.839 --> 00:24:53.039
Eldest Cousin means

00:24:54.119 --> 00:24:56.559
Prince Ning must have a mysterious person secretly aiding him.

00:24:58.319 --> 00:24:59.559
Who could this person be?

00:25:00.559 --> 00:25:01.640
I will have people watch Prince Ning.

00:25:02.079 --> 00:25:03.200
No matter who this person is,

00:25:03.599 --> 00:25:05.079
as long as they have plans,

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.799
they will surely reveal a flaw.

00:25:30.079 --> 00:25:31.480
Fortunately, you stole the antidote.

00:25:33.519 --> 00:25:34.799
Although we avoided disaster,

00:25:35.599 --> 00:25:36.400
Yuwen Rui

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.440
must already be aware of my existence.

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.319
You act with such caution.

00:25:42.759 --> 00:25:45.319
Could he possibly discover your identity?

00:25:45.799 --> 00:25:46.720
In the coming days,

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.200
don't make any rash moves.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:49.759
Unless absolutely necessary,

00:25:50.759 --> 00:25:52.039
we should not meet for now.

00:25:57.079 --> 00:25:58.640
I met Young Master Meng outside the city today.

00:25:59.359 --> 00:26:01.880
He's been searching for you all these days.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.480
Didn't he see the letter I left?

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:05.880
It's spread all over Luojing.

00:26:06.559 --> 00:26:08.000
Young Master Meng is offering a large reward to find a woman.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.559
My seventh cousin and I

00:26:09.759 --> 00:26:11.039
learned about this a few days ago.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.079
But we couldn't reveal your identity,

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.519
so we didn't tell

00:26:15.039 --> 00:26:16.200
Young Master Meng your whereabouts.

00:26:18.119 --> 00:26:19.519
Meng Shaojue is a righteous man.

00:26:19.759 --> 00:26:20.880
He must be thinking of

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.920
the favor I did by drawing the assassins away.

00:26:23.359 --> 00:26:24.559
He's worried I might be in danger.

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:26.279
I'll write another letter to send over later,

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.119
so they won't worry.

00:26:30.039 --> 00:26:30.559
Elder Imperial Sister,

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.960
how have things been with Seventh Cousin lately?

00:26:37.559 --> 00:26:39.319
I've been intentionally keeping my distance from him recently.

00:26:40.559 --> 00:26:41.519
He has someone he likes.

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.960
We should still maintain proper boundaries.

00:26:44.599 --> 00:26:45.160
Elder Imperial Sister,

00:26:46.319 --> 00:26:48.720
you do have feelings for Seventh Cousin, don't you?

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.920
After learning he has someone he likes,

00:26:55.319 --> 00:26:56.880
I realized my own feelings.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:58.559
You're not planning to tell him?

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.000
His heart belongs to someone else.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.640
Telling him would only cause unnecessary trouble.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:06.839
The male and female leads

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.160
are on a path of anguished, deep love?

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:16.400
Elder Imperial Sister,

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.119
this seems to belong to Seventh Cousin.

00:27:29.279 --> 00:27:30.559
Perhaps the one Seventh Cousin likes

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.359
is not someone else.

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.559
Brother said he has a lead on A Lan.

00:27:40.039 --> 00:27:40.759
Why didn't he tell me?

00:27:40.759 --> 00:27:41.960
Where exactly is A Lan?

00:27:45.839 --> 00:27:46.480
Lord He.

00:27:46.839 --> 00:27:47.359
Miss Meng.

00:27:54.039 --> 00:27:56.039
These books were not recommended by me.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.240
It's just a little trick by the bookseller.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.920
If Miss Meng enjoys martial arts training,

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.440
I, He, can actually recommend

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:03.519
some truly substantial works.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.200
As expected of Lord He.

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:07.640
In the future, when I refine my martial skills,

00:28:07.839 --> 00:28:08.960
I hope to have a chance to spar with you, my lord.

00:28:15.319 --> 00:28:17.440
Isn't this the birthday gift I gave my brother?

00:28:17.799 --> 00:28:19.599
It fell during the fight with that petty thief He.

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.000
How did it end up with Lord He?

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:23.960
This...

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:29.680
Lord He,

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.640
you couldn't possibly be that petty thief He, could you?

00:28:36.599 --> 00:28:37.759
My lord, you are full of righteousness.

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.400
How could you be the one who stole my purse

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.039
and injured me, that petty thief He?

00:28:43.519 --> 00:28:44.039
Miss Meng,

00:28:44.599 --> 00:28:45.720
this matter is something I can explain.

00:28:46.359 --> 00:28:47.079
Stealing your purse...

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:48.319
was because...

00:28:48.319 --> 00:28:49.000
It really is you!

00:28:49.519 --> 00:28:50.640
You kidnapped me several times,

00:28:50.799 --> 00:28:51.640
and stole my things!

00:28:52.279 --> 00:28:53.799
And here I was, I even...

00:28:53.799 --> 00:28:54.319
Miss Meng,

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:55.880
I, He, have wronged you.

00:28:58.440 --> 00:28:59.720
You, my lord, as the Commander of the Imperial Guards,

00:29:00.119 --> 00:29:01.720
actually engage in such sneaky, thieving acts?

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.519
I must have been blind

00:29:03.519 --> 00:29:04.720
to have admired you so much.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.240
Don't let me see you again!

00:29:30.839 --> 00:29:31.319
Fifth Princess.

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:32.920
I found some light reading for you.

00:29:33.039 --> 00:29:34.160
You can read them when you're bored.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.400
Can they even understand some of these words?

00:29:51.799 --> 00:29:52.720
What's there not to understand?

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.119
They definitely won't understand.

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:13.599
"Youthful genius" is one thing,

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.920
but "honest, kind, and pure-hearted" is a bit excessive, isn't it?

00:30:17.279 --> 00:30:18.319
How is that excessive?

00:30:18.519 --> 00:30:19.400
That's just our lord's true nature.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.119
Doesn't the outside world all say

00:30:24.279 --> 00:30:26.359
your lord is petty and exacting,

00:30:26.599 --> 00:30:27.480
ruthless and cruel?

00:30:28.599 --> 00:30:30.200
That's just slander spread by those with ulterior motives,

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.039
defaming our lord.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:32.880
Our lord just wants to do his job well.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.079
He can't be bothered with them.

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:35.119
Princess,

00:30:35.319 --> 00:30:35.759
you...

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:37.359
take a look at these books I found for you.

00:30:37.519 --> 00:30:38.400
So you won't have misunderstandings.

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:40.799
Just put them aside for now.

00:30:46.039 --> 00:30:46.440
Fifth...

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:51.519
What is it?

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:52.880
Fifth Princess,

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:56.680
actually, today is the anniversary of the old general and his wife's passing.

00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.839
Our lord has been planning to bring down Prince Ning

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:01.680
to avenge the old general and his wife.

00:31:02.079 --> 00:31:03.799
But His Majesty trusts Prince Ning too much.

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.119
The old general and his wife were killed by Prince Ning.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:09.960
When our lord was young,

00:31:10.359 --> 00:31:11.680
the old general and his wife passed away.

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:14.160
Our lord was left alone and helpless.

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:15.440
When he had nothing to do, he would go

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.960
to the training ground where the old general drilled troops.

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.160
He would stay for several days at a time.

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.480
Even that Wishing Tree outside

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.920
was specially moved here by our lord from the training ground.

00:31:29.839 --> 00:31:30.319
Princess,

00:31:30.319 --> 00:31:31.279
What are you doing, Ru Feng?

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.160
Please go see our lord, Princess.

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:33.880
Ru Feng, I'm telling you...

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:34.880
He's really too pitiful.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.119
Can you slow down?

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:43.839
Princess,

00:31:44.319 --> 00:31:46.119
I leave our lord in your hands.

00:31:47.039 --> 00:31:47.519
Wait...

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.279
What are you doing here?

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:13.680
That Wishing Tree was moved here by you from the training ground?

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:16.119
Ru Feng told you?

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:18.960
Ru Feng said

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.759
you had a serious illness when you were young,

00:32:21.079 --> 00:32:22.119
and almost lost your life.

00:32:22.559 --> 00:32:24.039
Later, you were alone and helpless,

00:32:24.039 --> 00:32:24.920
with no protection.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.119
Often you didn't know where your next meal was coming from,

00:32:27.559 --> 00:32:29.000
and were bullied by other children.

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:31.000
But, my lord, you are naturally gifted and clever.

00:32:31.319 --> 00:32:32.559
Except for the last sentence,

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.680
the rest was probably Zixiu.

00:32:36.079 --> 00:32:37.000
I suspected it was him too.

00:32:37.119 --> 00:32:39.119
Eight out of ten things he says are false.

00:32:40.359 --> 00:32:42.480
My lord, you clearly don't look like someone who gets bullied.

00:32:44.359 --> 00:32:44.880
However,

00:32:45.839 --> 00:32:46.799
there's one thing he said

00:32:47.839 --> 00:32:48.880
that must be true.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:50.680
What is it?

00:32:54.839 --> 00:32:55.680
He said

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.079
you take on too much yourself.

00:33:11.119 --> 00:33:12.640
I was wondering why on that Wishing Tree

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.240
there were so many "return safely" wishes.

00:33:15.319 --> 00:33:16.200
Now that I think about it,

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.240
they were probably made by the soldiers

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:20.759
who fought alongside you.

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.599
You led them to the battlefield,

00:33:25.079 --> 00:33:26.640
but couldn't bring them all back.

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:34.599
Why isn't it here?

00:33:35.119 --> 00:33:36.880
Yunmi is now peaceful and prosperous.

00:33:37.319 --> 00:33:38.440
The people live and work in contentment.

00:33:39.359 --> 00:33:41.519
All of this was left by you and those soldiers.

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.240
A Lan.

00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:27.800
Yuwen Rui.

00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:30.360
Yuwen Rui.

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:34.440
Yuwen Rui.

00:34:38.239 --> 00:34:39.599
His drinking manners are terrible.

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:51.039
Your Highness.

00:34:52.079 --> 00:34:54.079
Your handwriting is much better than mine, my lord.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:55.800
Why don't you have him help you write it?

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.039
Why are you asking so many questions?

00:34:58.480 --> 00:34:59.000
Write it properly.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:00.559
Remember to add a line.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.079
Say that I'll visit them at the Meng Mansion in a few days.

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:04.480
Tell them not to worry about me.

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.000
Is your lord awake yet?

00:35:15.559 --> 00:35:16.280
He woke up long ago.

00:35:16.519 --> 00:35:17.159
Right now,

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.320
he's probably busy in the study.

00:35:19.239 --> 00:35:20.079
My lord drank too much last night.

00:35:20.239 --> 00:35:21.159
He can't remember anything.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:23.440
Can't remember.

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.400
He can't remember a thing.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:28.960
It seems he only remembers

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.239
that Your Highness drank a few cups with him.

00:35:31.239 --> 00:35:32.000
Th-then what?

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:33.039
There's no 'then'.

00:35:36.199 --> 00:35:36.719
Your Highness,

00:35:37.079 --> 00:35:38.360
if you said something

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:39.760
or did something important,

00:35:40.039 --> 00:35:40.480
it's fine.

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.960
When you see my lord later,

00:35:42.159 --> 00:35:43.400
you can explain it to him carefully.

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:45.639
N-no, nothing important.

00:35:48.119 --> 00:35:48.920
Are you done with the letter?

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:50.639
Remember to explain at the end,

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.320
say I spent half a coin

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.920
to hire a literate beggar

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:54.960
to help me write this letter.

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:55.440
Beg...

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:07.960
Your Highness?

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:08.679
Alright.

00:36:15.079 --> 00:36:15.519
Your Highness.

00:36:16.239 --> 00:36:19.360
I have a favor to ask.

00:36:20.199 --> 00:36:21.320
Go ahead, what is it?

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:25.880
I see that Your Highness and my lord

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:26.960
are quite close.

00:36:27.119 --> 00:36:27.400
I was thinking...

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.199
Which eye of yours sees

00:36:28.199 --> 00:36:29.800
that I'm close with your lord?

00:36:32.159 --> 00:36:33.159
You even slept in the same room.

00:36:33.159 --> 00:36:34.320
Isn't that close enough?

00:36:37.239 --> 00:36:38.119
Not close, not close.

00:36:39.039 --> 00:36:41.400
I see that Your Highness and my lord

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:42.639
aren't very close.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000
So I wanted to learn more about Miss Xixi.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:54.760
Don't worry.

00:36:55.079 --> 00:36:56.280
I'll take care of it.

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:10.840
Your Highness,

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.440
why not have Young Master Meng come here to see you?

00:37:14.039 --> 00:37:14.920
Better not.

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:17.239
Yuwen Rui and he are naturally incompatible.

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:18.880
If the two of them meet,

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.360
they'd probably tear this villa down.

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:24.639
Alright.

00:37:26.519 --> 00:37:27.119
Your Highness,

00:37:27.559 --> 00:37:30.000
has Young Master Meng never realized you're pretending to be foolish?

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.159
If he knew you were hiding your identity,

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:33.320
he wouldn't get angry, would he?

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:35.760
I think

00:37:36.239 --> 00:37:37.440
he noticed long ago.

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.000
He just didn't expose me.

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:40.360
He's having fun at my expense.

00:37:41.159 --> 00:37:42.800
Young Master Meng is really romantic.

00:37:43.039 --> 00:37:44.199
Not like Lord Yuwen.

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:47.000
I think Young Master Meng is more suitable for you, Your Highness.

00:37:47.679 --> 00:37:49.199
Stop playing matchmaker.

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.559
Think about yourself instead.

00:37:54.159 --> 00:37:55.719
Have you ever thought about

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.159
when you'll find a suitable husband?

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.079
Why is Your Highness suddenly asking about this?

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:03.039
This servant wishes to stay...

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:04.519
Don't you dare say

00:38:05.159 --> 00:38:07.039
"This servant wishes to stay by Your Highness's side forever,

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.400
I won't go anywhere,

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.119
I don't want to marry."

00:38:11.039 --> 00:38:12.559
That's how the loyal maidservants act in dramas.

00:38:12.559 --> 00:38:13.400
They all perform like that.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:14.719
You don't need to be like that.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:15.280
Really.

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.880
What are you saying, Your Highness?

00:38:18.119 --> 00:38:20.039
"Stay by Your Highness's side forever"?

00:38:20.239 --> 00:38:21.000
"Won't go anywhere"?

00:38:21.199 --> 00:38:22.039
"And won't marry"?

00:38:22.559 --> 00:38:23.639
Why would I do that?

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:26.760
This servant wishes to stay in the palace.

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:27.880
After Your Highness gets married,

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:29.719
once I've saved enough silver,

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.159
and reached marriageable age,

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.119
I'll leave the palace and rent a shop.

00:38:33.119 --> 00:38:34.480
I'll sell some pastries and cakes.

00:38:36.559 --> 00:38:38.719
Why would I stay by Your Highness's side forever?

00:38:40.159 --> 00:38:42.360
You really are an unusual girl.

00:38:43.519 --> 00:38:45.400
Your Highness isn't reluctant to part with me, are you?

00:38:49.239 --> 00:38:50.199
In my humble opinion,

00:38:50.519 --> 00:38:51.840
the person Your Highness will marry in the future

00:38:52.119 --> 00:38:54.119
will either be Lord Yuwen or Young Master Meng.

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.159
When I leave the palace later,

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:59.000
I'll rent a shop close to both the Meng Mansion

00:38:59.000 --> 00:38:59.920
and the Yuwen Residence.

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.760
That way, it'll be convenient for you to visit me.

00:39:02.159 --> 00:39:02.880
Don't wait for later.

00:39:03.239 --> 00:39:03.920
Once we're back in the palace,

00:39:04.079 --> 00:39:06.079
I'll beg Father to let you leave the palace early.

00:39:07.639 --> 00:39:08.840
So after you leave the palace

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:09.840
and rent your shop,

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.039
have you thought about

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:15.679
what kind of man you'd want to marry?

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:20.679
Naturally, one who likes me

00:39:21.199 --> 00:39:22.440
and is genuinely good to me.

00:39:25.599 --> 00:39:26.719
Then, when the time comes,

00:39:26.719 --> 00:39:28.360
I'll give you a whole room full of dowry.

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:28.800
How about that?

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:30.960
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:39:35.519 --> 00:39:36.000
On second thought,

00:39:36.639 --> 00:39:38.960
I'd better wait until after Your Highness is married to leave the palace.

00:39:39.519 --> 00:39:40.159
Without me,

00:39:40.599 --> 00:39:42.719
Your Highness would probably only end up marrying Lord Yuwen.

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.159
No, no, no.

00:39:44.159 --> 00:39:45.159
What are you muttering?

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:47.039
Nothing.

00:39:47.559 --> 00:39:48.679
Your Highness, please rest well.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:49.840
This servant will take her leave now.

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:07.760
You heard everything clearly.

00:40:09.119 --> 00:40:09.960
As expected of Xixi.

00:40:10.239 --> 00:40:12.039
She's truly different from ordinary girls.

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:14.559
She's actually a good match for you.

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:17.119
If she really does fall for you in the future,

00:40:17.519 --> 00:40:18.440
and marries you,

00:40:18.679 --> 00:40:19.800
you must treat her well.

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:20.920
Otherwise...

00:40:21.079 --> 00:40:21.599
Rest assured, Your Highness.

00:40:22.079 --> 00:40:22.920
I understand completely.

00:40:46.639 --> 00:40:48.039
Yinglu is sure to like this one.
