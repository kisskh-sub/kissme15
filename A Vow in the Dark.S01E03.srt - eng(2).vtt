00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.350
(This is outrageous.)

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.120
(Foolish fish.)

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.480
(Her spiritual power)

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.480
(has a healing effect.)

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.200
(How rare.)

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.840
Why is this pillow so cold and hard?

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.120
Pervert!

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.870
Don't shout.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.200
You...

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.120
What trick are you up to now?

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.000
Trick? I should be asking you that.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.060
In the middle of the night,

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.970
it's my bed in my room!

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.430
Your bed?

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.470
The Demon Realm belongs to me.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.080
Let me make this clear.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.630
Stop your little schemes.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.680
Otherwise,

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.310
killing a fish

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.400
would be child's play.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.470
You... I...

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.430
Jie Chuan.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:03.670
Address me as Your Grace.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.360
Your Grace.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.830
The Immortal Realm
has learned you broke the seal.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.310
They are rallying their troops

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.080
and may strike at any moment.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.590
To ensure safety,

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.800
I have reforged our defenses

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.800
and drawn a new Array.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.520
The immortals

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.500
are nothing to be feared.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.240
But the intentions of Jin Li

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.190
sent by them remain unclear.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.240
I'll play along.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.360
Perfect timing.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.150
The Demon Defense Array

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.480
is a matter of great importance.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.120
No one is allowed to leak it.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.520
Understood.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.560
(The Demon Defense Array?)

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.080
(Once I get that,)

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.120
(I can clear my name as a traitor,)

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.000
(so I won't be punished heavily.)

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.630
Sweep this spot.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.870
Yes.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.510
You, sweep over here.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.370
Yes.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.220
Come with me.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.160
Go tidy up the bookshelf.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.000
Alright.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.800
Make sure every corner is spotless.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.000
(The Demon Defense Array.)

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.510
(Where could it be?)

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.510
Where did you come from?

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.360
This candle is made
from millennium wax.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.390
But you...

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.830
I didn't mean to.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.680
Which hall are you from?

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.360
I've never seen you before.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.510
I'm new here.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:08.390
New?

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.070
We haven't recruited in centuries.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.480
Speak the truth.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.830
- Let's go to Ms. Luo.
- I am new here!

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.360
- (Such a lousy thief.)
- Sorry!

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.200
(Why did Hong Zhua)

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.160
(take you as his disciple?)

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.480
What happened?

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:28.800
Your Grace, she...

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:31.600
You may go.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.500
Yes.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.510
You stay

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.070
to serve me.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.200
Me?

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.230
Yes.

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:58.110
Put more strength into it.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.270
A bit higher.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.950
Add some force.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.190
Yes, Your Grace

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.800
(Where exactly is the Array?)

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.190
(Foolish fish.)

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.160
You, go over there.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.030
Oh.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:50.830
Your Grace.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:54.480
Are you here to make amends?

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:57.240
Since you're willing
to serve here as a maid,

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.070
you'd better behave.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:02.950
Don't be too curious

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:05.190
about this bookshelf.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.070
If anything goes missing,

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:11.350
I will not

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.480
spare you.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.480
This bookshelf?

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.030
Anything unusual here?

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:37.390
Is it hidden here?

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:50.630
Your Grace.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.550
The miasma is worsening.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:55.950
I've moved the injured demons
outside the hall.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.150
Let's go

00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.990
and take a look.

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:19.510
Your Grace,

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.750
we've used the pure water made
from forbidden flowers.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.600
But it may not hold for long.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:25.800
Thank you.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:32.600
Jie Chuan,

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.720
your wounds aren't healed.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.750
You must not use Demonic Ether.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.400
- Step aside.
- What's wrong?

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:42.230
Stay close to me.

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:45.270
(I can't let anyone know)

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.550
(an Immortal Beast can hold me at bay.)

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.630
(As the ruler of the realm,)

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.000
(he'd actually drain his power)

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.240
(for the common demons.)

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:29.470
Well,

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.440
I don't think

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.840
you can get rid

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.340
of the long-existing miasma this way.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.100
Why not plant some immortal herbs?

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.580
It'll help you in the long run.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.540
The matters here

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:42.940
are none of your concern.

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.740
How fickle.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:50.260
I can save them, too.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.140
As I said,

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.580
I don't divide lives

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:54.540
into ranks.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:41.820
My spiritual power is depleted.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.340
But I can save them.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.220
If you trust me,

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.100
take me up there.

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:22.100
(He may look cold,)

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.060
(but he's actually kind.)

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.660
(But if I give the Array to Master,)

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:30.900
(he'll probably be locked
in the Void Land again.)

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:45.500
Thanks, Your Grace, Miss.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.460
Stealing this Array was almost too easy.

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.220
What if it's a trap?

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.540
Master has been here before.

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:12.580
He can tell if it's genuine.

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:15.220
I'll teleport it to Master.

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:16.340
Let's go check over there.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.260
(Forbidden Land of the Demon Realm)

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.520
I didn't know the Demon Realm
had such beautiful places.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.940
Goldfish, teleport it to Master.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.260
Hurry, eat it.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.100
Eat up, you chubby fish.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.140
Those who trespass
into the Forbidden Land

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:13.500
should die.

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.780
I didn't know
this was the Forbidden Land.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:19.820
As the Demon Sovereign,

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.220
you're being so petty.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.660
There aren't any traps
or magical tools.

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:24.820
Only one oasis remains.

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.620
A thick mist shrouds all around.

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.540
Only in the center
does sunlight break through.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.740
As the Demon Sovereign,

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.860
you shouldn't claim this land
for yourself.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:33.300
As you know,

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.380
we have but this sliver of sunlight.

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.300
I'm not the one who set it

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:39.660
as the Forbidden Land.

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:40.700
All demons chose

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.140
to guard it of their own accord.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:43.620
You immortals,

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:44.540
no matter your rank,

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.060
have the dew and light
to cultivate with.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.460
But demons have only

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:51.740
this single patch of sunlight.

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:53.860
You once asked

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.620
why we lack your flowers

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:57.820
to draw in the miasma.

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:00.140
Now, do you have your answer?

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.780
This isn't a reason for you

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:06.660
to wage war against us.

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:08.780
Do you really think I started it?

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:11.300
When survival becomes a distant dream,

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.340
resistance

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.660
is no longer a choice.

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:16.540
Perhaps

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.980
the two clans

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:20.860
could talk things through.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.260
Talk?

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.100
With those immortals

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.700
full of themselves?

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:29.340
Or with your master,

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.380
who destroyed my city?

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:32.660
Or maybe

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:35.060
with you,

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.500
a weak fraudster?

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:39.660
Do immortals ever care

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.780
about the fate of demons?

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.300
Don't think I'm blind
to what you're up to.

♪Thin wisps of smoke weave
through the river♪

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:02.680

drunk beneath the sunset♪

sway the falling leaves♪

in this life♪

with tangled love and hate♪

time flows with its trials♪

as winter snow carries the starlight♪

the ballad endures♪
