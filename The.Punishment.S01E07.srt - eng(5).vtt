So, everyone, what do you think?

00:08:58.920 --> 00:08:59.920
Well, Madam Wen,

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:02.410
when you ask like that,

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:04.440
who dares to speak up?

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:06.030
If you ask me,

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:06.740
we should

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:08.300
take another vote.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:09.130
Right?

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.760
Whether people agree or not,

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:12.670
let's see what everyone thinks.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:14.500
Okay.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.150
I'd like to know what everyone thinks too.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:19.690

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:35.400
I was hoping you'd stir things up

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:36.680
and organize a vote,

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.460
to see if there's anyone
left in the village

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.070
who still supports Ma Jin and Luo Bo.

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:43.070

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.820
At least there are still people

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.270
who support my ideas.

I know everyone is very anxious right now.

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:41.750
If it was just about money,
that would be one thing.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:43.750
But what they want to demolish now

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:46.270
is the home
we've depended on for 300 years.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.990
We people of Longwan have come this far

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:51.510
by never bowing our heads

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:52.940
and never surrendering.

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:54.670
So I hope

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.670
that no matter what happens,

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.760
we can all stand united

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:00.670
and overcome these difficulties together.

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:01.640
Great!

So busy.

Didn't you say

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:41.460
this case wasn't your responsibility,

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:43.120

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.380
I'm just concerned about you two.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:49.400
Don't even mention it.

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:51.930

to investigate this company.

What did I tell you?

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:04.650
Technically,

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:05.740
Wang Ming's case

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:08.820
isn't my responsibility,
so I shouldn't interfere.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:09.650
But if

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:11.580
it involves financial crimes,

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:13.790
you need to report to me promptly.

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:15.050
Don't worry, Captain Ji.

If he doesn't tell you, I will.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:18.780
What are you talking about?

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.050
If I don't report
financial crimes to our Big Bro,

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:22.500
can you investigate if I tell you instead?

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.280
Look at that.

Nobody invited you?

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:03.770
I just said

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:05.200
I have plans.

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:12.810
-Done?
-It's done.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.090
Keep this copy.

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:16.550
I'm leaving, Yuhong.

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:17.320
Okay.

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:26.240
[Rainbow Network]

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.560
[Rainbow Network]

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:34.920
Do you have plans tonight?

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:35.920
I'd like to treat you to Japanese food.

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.980
Didn't you just say you have
a business dinner tonight?

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:41.400
What's the fun in dining with them?

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:44.520
If I want to enjoy my meal...

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:50.200
I've got to eat with you.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.350
What a coincidence.

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:56.750
I'm on a diet these days,
not eating dinner.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:58.870
Get out of here now.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:00.770
I have a ton of things to do today, okay?

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:01.870
I'm not messing around with you anymore.

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:03.440
Save the work for another day.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.099
Besides, with your figure,
why bother dieting?

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:08.910
If you're really that bored,

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:12.040
why don't you go home
and spend time with your wife and kids?

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.630
More importantly,
keep your father-in-law company.

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:16.450
We both rely on him to make money.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:17.890
This is very important.

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:22.680
You've never been married.

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:24.089
You don't understand.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.430
I don't have any passion left now.

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:28.150
What is passion?

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:31.150
Passion

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.280
is a man's lifeline.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.240
If you can't stand it anymore,

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.570
then just get divorced.

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:41.170
Divorce would be easy.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.560
It's just not the right time yet.

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:46.450
Not the right time.

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:49.210
Since you don't have the courage,

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:55.080
then just be a good son-in-law
who married into your wife's family.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:59.030
I really don't have time for you today.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.040
If you insist on staying here,

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:01.970
that's fine too.

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:04.240
You can have the office.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.500
Take care of yourself.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.250
I won't be keeping you company.

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:11.290
You really won't dine with me?

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.000
No time.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.580
I'm leaving.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.390
Take care.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:40.430
Take care, Bo.

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:43.190
Mr. Liu, let's go have another drink.

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.800
Let's go.

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:04.350
Crazy.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.690
I ran into them while working.

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.060
That guy is your brother, right?

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:08.780
Yes.

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:10.480
How did he end up hanging out with Luo Bo?

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.560
Alright, I got it.

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:25.590
Come on.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.150
Drink up today.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.210
Yeah, drink as much as you want.

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:39.190
You can really hold your liquor, Mr. Liu.

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:40.520
I can't keep up with you.

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:46.590
I can't take anymore.

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:47.220
No, no, no.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.850
I can't handle it. I'm done.

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:49.790
Mr. Liu.

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:53.350
[No smoking]

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:54.140
Feng.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.570
You... why are you here?

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.240
Did you come by yourself?

00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:59.630
Have a few drinks.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:00.270
Come on.

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:01.560
I have friends here.

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:02.990
Up to no good.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.450
Are you hanging out with Luo Bo now?

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:08.080
No,

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:08.930
I...

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.680
I'm not close with Luo Bo.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:12.830
You're still lying to me.

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:14.000
I'm not lying to you.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:14.480
Let's go.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.540
Let's have a drink.

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:16.630
Come back with me.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:17.520
Back?

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:18.320
Well, Feng,

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.110
my buddies are all here.

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:21.350
We're only halfway through our drinks.

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:22.430
Come back with me.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:29.720
Fine.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:32.260
Um...

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:33.830
Um, hey guys, you go ahead and drink.

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:34.490
I need to...

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.480
-I’m going back.
-Where are you going?

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.480
The drinks are on me. Put it on my tab.

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:38.870
On you...

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:42.000
Feng, take it easy.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.830
-Go in.
-I just want to make some money.

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:44.520
Mr. Luo...

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:45.110
Move forward.

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:46.080
Well, at Mr. Luo's place...

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:46.870
Stand right here.

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:47.830
I just went there...

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:49.070
-Stand here.
-It’s not illegal.

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:50.000
What's going on?

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:54.210
Did you know he's been
hanging around Luo Bo's place?

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:55.270
Shut up.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.700
Tianye really didn't know.

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:57.700
Do you know or not?

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:00.380
I sent him there.

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:03.630
You want him to die?

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:04.460
Well.

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.150
We civilians also want to
take down Ma Jin and Luo Bo.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:07.670
Right.

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:09.130
Otherwise none of us
will ever have a good life.

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:10.580
I'm just trying to help, that's all.

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:11.440
Besides, he...

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:12.760
He has a proper image.

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:13.690
A proper what?

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:14.870
Image.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:17.740
Just look at him.

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:20.420
Right, put your hands in your pockets.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:21.880
Yes, in your back pockets.

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:23.680
Look at him.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:25.250
You definitely can't find
someone like him at your place.

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:26.560
He's perfect to send to Luo Bo.

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.410
They will trust
someone who looks like that.

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:30.280
Afterward, we'll work with you
from the inside and outside.

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:32.670
-Police and the people—one family, right?
-Yes, we are a family.

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:35.270
With this image,
he can go deep behind enemy lines?

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:35.930
My image...

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.380
You think we can't get things done?

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:37.810
No.

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:39.440
We have to count on you
to help gather information?

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.100
What's wrong with my image...

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:42.140
Just shut up.

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.320
I'm worried about
procedural complications for you.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.340
Aren't you fooling around?

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:47.800
What are you doing hanging out there?

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.260
I wasn't just hanging out.

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:50.350
Tianye said I have a proper image.

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:51.170
So how could my image be bad?

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:53.490
Besides, I didn't go there for nothing.

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:54.980
Feng, let me show you.

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:56.450
See for yourself.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.120
Got a lead?

00:21:58.150 --> 00:21:59.630
Of course I have a lead.

00:21:59.740 --> 00:21:59.800
A payment record, isn't it?

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.060
[Binjiang Bank: ¥30,000 has been
credited to your debit card.]

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:02.060
[Payer Name: Rainbow Network Co., Ltd.]

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:03.750
See for yourself.

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:06.420
They just transferred money to me.

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:08.700
Rainbow Network Company.

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:11.210
I've already found out the name for you.

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:12.050
Let me tell you.

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:14.440
All their money goes through this company.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:15.350
No matter what it is,

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:16.110
loan shark money,

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:17.080
gambling money, whatever,

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.610
it all passes through them.

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:20.340
You know Song Hao, right?

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:22.000
He's the one who gave them this idea.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.080
And Song Hao

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.030
is very close to a woman known as...

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.530
Yuhong,

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:27.700
the company's owner.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:29.900
You can follow this lead

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:30.990
and you'll definitely find something.

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:32.390
Isn't this a useful lead?

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:33.590
Isn't it?

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:35.690
So this is what you two
have been plotting.

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:37.140
Tell me if this lead is useful or not.

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:39.190
You sent him there
as an undercover, didn't you?

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:40.590
Well, didn't we say

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:42.000
that police and people are one family?

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.190
Have you lost your mind?

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:44.450
How can they trust you?

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:45.480
You're even trying to set them up?

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:45.960
Why wouldn't they trust me?

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:46.590
Stand right there.

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:47.250
Don't move.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.860
You sent him to Luo Bo's place.

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:53.480
Are you afraid he's not
learning bad habits fast enough?

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.340
-Well.
-I didn't mean it that way.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:56.180
You

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.860
sent him to Luo Bo's place.

00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:59.240
How can he have a good future?

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.630
Just tell me whether it's useful or not.

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:01.720
Don't give me that nonsense.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.970
Starting today,

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:04.460
stay away from these people.

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:05.370
Don't go there anymore.

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:06.000
Understand?

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:06.480
Well,

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.520
Ma Jin and Luo Bo already trust me.

you can help me transfer money abroad

I'm just talking to you.

00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:29.440
I think we should
keep a close eye on Qian Yuhong.

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:30.270
But I think

00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:32.400
she's just one of Ma Jin's underlings.

00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:34.700
Just like Scar, Damao, and Ermao.

00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:35.700
Even if we arrest her,

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:38.160
she probably won't reveal anything useful.

00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:40.020
Should we try

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:41.180
a different approach?

00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:43.580
Like psychological tactics or something?

00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:44.710
How would we do that?

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:46.670

Alright,

00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:53.730
I'll ask Mai to look into it.

00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:56.140
Quickly take the child home.

00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:57.600
Put the bag around my neck.

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:00.830
