[Previously]
Have you never tried it before?

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:13.860
No.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.996
Geez, why would you think of him?

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.636
Don't even think about it, Kaew.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.580
Will you please allow me
to get to know you more?

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.716
Don't let your feelings grow too
far, or else you might regret it later.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:31.836
Khun Yai!

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.797
Khun Yai.

00:00:32.821 --> 00:00:34.796
- Khun Yai.
- Shhh!

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.796
Did you send him to spy on them?

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.676
I must apologise for
causing you trouble, Uncle.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.356
I'm willing to do anything for our country.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.580
Sir, Khun Prom is here.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.276
- Kan!
- Yes, sir.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.980
Go stall time for me. Tell him I'll be
there when I'm done with my business.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Ruedee.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.460
Wait!

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.000
Is someone injured?

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.600
Yes, sir. It's just a
fight between servants.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.860
Is it that serious?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Prom.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.600
What matter has brought you here?

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.460
I see Khun Phra Nai coming to
visit this place almost every day,

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.700
so I'm curious what it is
that he finds interesting here.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.540
I'm merely here to talk about
musical instruments with Uncle.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.330
You already know that he
is my treble fiddle's teacher.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.380
I was only joking.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.980
As a matter of fact, Father has
asked me to deliver this to you.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.180
These are fruits from our orchard.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.500
How considerate.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.796
Actually, you don't need
to come bearing any gift.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.340
Just a greeting would already
make an old man like me happy.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.260
Please don't say that.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.620
Father said his adopted son
often comes here to bother you.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.380
So, he'd like to return
the gratitude somehow.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.460
I must be going then.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.500
Do you think your brother
honestly wanted to pay me a visit?

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.940
Of course not.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.940
Even if it's Father's
order, a man like Prom…

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.660
Would never do it if he doesn't want to.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.800
Then, why do you think he came here?

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.780
I'd like to know that too.

[Interminable]

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.460
Anarchist Association.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.400
Hello, sir. This way, please.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.660
Is there something urgent, sir?

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.800
I've called for an urgent meeting today…

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.500
Because we've found someone spying on us.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:24.140
Although we managed to
capture him, he somehow escaped.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.780
Do you know who sent him?

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.420
We don't know yet.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.900
But I want all of you to look for
a man who got shot by an arrow.

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:41.730
I believe he must go see a doctor to
have his wound tended somewhere.

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:45.100
An arrow, sir?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.960
It seems Chao Meun Sri
Sorarak has something to tell us.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:00.860
Yes.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.220
Father.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:23.460
You're back, Yai?

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:28.600
Yes, Father. Uncle said thank you for the
gift you've asked Prom to deliver to him.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:36.700
Hm? I don't remember asking
him to visit Luang Sanor though.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.420
Is that so?

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.740
Then, he probably prepared that gift
himself. I must have misunderstood.

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:54.260
How surprising, I never expected he would
know to pay respect to the elder ones.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.700
I guess he's quite matured now.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.730
Khun Prom is acting
very suspicious, Khun Yai.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:17.500
Saen, send someone to keep an eye on Prom.

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.460
Yes, sir.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.140
Wait, Saen.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.530
What is it, sir?

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.360
How is it, Dum?

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.340
Nothing unusual so far.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.100
Let's split up and check again.

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:56.820
Sure.

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:57.876
You, come with me.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:58.900
Yes.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.340
Who sent you?

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.380
Go after him!

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.660
Kaew, how's your mother doing?

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.620
She's better now.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:57.200
Good to hear that. I'm
thinking of paying her a visit.

00:10:58.660 --> 00:10:59.940
Go ahead.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.020
You didn't come for many days.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:11.260
Do you know there was a ruckus here?

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.930
What? What happened?

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:21.660
People are talking…that two days
ago a thief broke into this place.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:26.900
Thief? Did they catch him?

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.500
No, he got away first.

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:38.676
I don't know if this has something to do with that
injured man Khun Phra Nai has asked us to look after.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:39.700
Ruedee!

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.700
Didn't Luang Sanor say we
shouldn't tell anyone about it?

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.740
But Kan, Kaew isn't just anyone.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.676
To be honest, if Khun Phra
Nai hadn't brought that man here,

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:58.540
Luang Sanor probably wouldn't
have been troubled this much.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:07.900
Now that you've mentioned it, I haven't
seen Khun Phra Nai for many days now.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.300
Kaew, are you back?

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.596
Yes, Uncle.

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.660
That's good.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.820
The ceremony day is approaching.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.160
You all must stay focus and practice hard.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:33.400
Yes, sir.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.780
So, isn't Khun Phra here yet?

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:38.130
Not yet, sir.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:45.340
Dum, take the boat and
go pick up Khun Phra Vichit.

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:50.580
He's quite old now.
I'm afraid he might fall.

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:53.730
Has the chief called for me urgently?

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.800
Yes, sir.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:55.860
Let's hurry then.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.500
Prom, are you rushing somewhere?

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.580
I don't think it has anything
to do with you, Khun Phra Nai.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:08.540
On the surface, our country might
seem to be at peace right now.

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:14.220
But who knows, there might be a massive
wave quietly building up underneath.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.140
I'm worried. That's why I want to warn you.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:22.530
Warn me? About what?

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:25.980
About the people you associate with.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.560
Some people are easily
deceived by ideology.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:36.900
So much that they fail to notice some paths might
not lead them to glory, but rather a disaster.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.540
Whatever you'll do, always
think of Father and your family.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.200
Don't be so full of yourself.

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:49.540
I've never seen you as a sibling,
only just an orphan Father has pity on.

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.460
We're not related!

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:57.700
Don't you dare act all high and
mighty and tell me what to do.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:22.916
Khun Prom's henchman is probably that thief who
broke into Luang Sanor's house the other day.

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.700
I can recognize his frame.

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:30.380
Fortunately, you reacted quickly and had our
guy who's injured moved out of that place first.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:36.060
Now we can be sure that Prom certainly has
something to do with the Anarchist Association.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.000
You want me to get rid of Yai, Chief?

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:25.460
Yes. Didn't you say so yourself that Khun Phra
Nai is the one who sent that rat to spy on us?

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:26.960
Well, yes.

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:35.600
Then, we should nip it in the
bud…and destroy it completely.

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:43.180
You're the one who knows Khun Phra Nai the
best. That's why you're perfect for this job.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:50.530
Or are you hesitating
because he's your brother?

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:56.220
No, I've never seen
that brat as my brother.

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:59.260
I'm only concerned it might be too violent.

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:05.220
Have you forgotten that we're not
doing this for any particular person?

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:10.420
We're fighting for our
nation…for our people!

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:17.580
Only someone with a heart full of courage
would be able to make this mission successful.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:27.360
And I can see that in you, Khun Prom.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.100
Yes, sir. I will not let you down, Chief.

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:39.700
Good. You can go now.

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:58.160
Khun Prom surely respects you a lot, sir.

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:02.220
A boy who grew up being overlooked…

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.859
And always placed behind his brother
who isn't even related to him by blood.

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:11.940
All we have to do is
make him feel 'important'.

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:17.579
And he'll place his life by our
feet before he even realizes it.

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:41.860
[Sigh] Is he all right?

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.060
Who are you waiting for, Kaew?

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.200
Mum.

00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:01.930
I've seen you sitting here in front of our
house for a while now. Who are you waiting for?

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:05.060
Well…it's Ruedee.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:09.460
Oh, Ruedee? I'll go prepare more food then.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:13.060
No need, Mum.

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.220
It's late. I don't think
she'll come anymore.

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:19.730
Then, come along and eat something.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.340
Yes, Mum.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.730
What are you hoping for?

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.200
Aren't you happy that
he's not coming anymore?

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:06.220
But why do I feel so…? [Sigh]

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.540
I want you to be careful though.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:25.100
Don't let your feelings grow too
far, or else you might regret it later.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:51.540
Although I don't get to see your face, just
a glimpse of your roof can make me happy.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.730
Mock me all you like.

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.700
I know you often go stealing
glimpses of Ruedee's roof too.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.420
Let's go. I must get to
see Kaewta tomorrow.

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.100
Khun Phra Nai.

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:40.260
I've been waiting for you.

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.100
Is there something you want to talk to me?

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.530
Aren't you on your way
to Luang Sanor's place?

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:49.900
I just want to accompany you.

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:56.500
Please don't. I walk there
every day. I can go alone.

00:20:58.860 --> 00:20:59.860
Wait!

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:03.900
I still haven't got to talk
to you about many things.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:10.200
But I don't have anything to talk
to Chao Meun Samur Jairatch.

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:16.100
Why did you call me like
that? Like I'm a stranger to you.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:25.930
I thought you already understood
everything I had told you earlier.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.900
Understood what?

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:38.060
Can't you see? That I'm not a lady.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.460
Why would you keep pestering me?

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.100
Is it because you hate me?

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.160
It's because we're both men.

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:58.820
Even though we're
both men, it's still love.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.700
I love you, Kaew.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.476
How can you say it so easily like that?

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:11.980
Why make it difficult?

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:17.820
Kaew!

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.200
Khun Yai!

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:30.860
Khun Yai!

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:40.620
Run, Kaew!

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:42.500
Khun Yai…

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:48.740
Khun Yai!

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:51.220
Khun Yai!

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:54.740
Kaew!

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.180
Kaew!

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:57.260
Kaew!

00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:58.356
Kaew!

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.020
- Kaew!
- What happened, Kaew?

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:00.930
Kaew!

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:01.917
Kaew!

00:23:01.941 --> 00:23:03.556
Kaew! Kaew!

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.940
Kaew, are you all right?

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.060
I'm fine.

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:18.260
But Khun Yai…

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.530
Kaew! What are you doing?

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.330
Khun Yai got hurt because he saved me.

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:36.940
I want to know if he's all right.

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:44.540
You can't, Kaew. Luangta Cham only allows you
to recall your past life for only an hour.

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:46.380
Don't you remember?

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.300
But what if Khun Yai dies
because he has saved me?

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:55.060
I have to find out.

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:01.620
Chai…

00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:04.930
Kaew…

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:07.860
Don't, Kaew!

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:13.700
Kaew, Ruedee and I have
already promised Aunt Chan…

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.600
That we'll never let you do
anything that might harm yourself.

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:21.236
He's right, Kaew.

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:28.300
Luangta Cham also said that if you don't strictly
follow his order, something bad might happen to you.

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:38.580
But I just want to make
sure that Khun Yai is safe.

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:42.020
Can't you just let me do that?

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:52.330
Ruedee!

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.220
That's the sound of Khun Yai
playing treble fiddle. Can you hear it?

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:02.260
Khun Yai!

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:03.197
Kaew!

00:25:03.221 --> 00:25:04.500
Kaew!

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:05.460
Khun Yai!

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:09.196
Khun Yai! Are you around here?

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:11.500
Kaew!

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:13.460
What is it?

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:18.660
Can't you hear it, Ruedee? It's
Khun Yai playing treble fiddle.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.260
I can't hear anything.

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.600
Have I imagined it?

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:39.460
You might not. But Khun Yai might
want to warn you not too overdo it.

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:45.600
There's still tomorrow, Kaew.

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:48.700
You're exhausted now.

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.860
Maybe you should go and get some rest.

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.960
Your mum is probably worried about you now.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.820
Please get some rest, my dear.

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:14.900
Come on, let's go, Kaew.

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:06.260
Kaew, are you still up, dear?

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.100
I'll go to bed soon.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.916
Come, I'll put you to bed.
Don't worry about it too much.

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:17.540
Let's sort it out tomorrow, okay?

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:18.677
Yes.

00:27:18.701 --> 00:27:20.140
Good boy.

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:24.000
Get some sleep, dear.

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:27.540
You should get some sleep too.

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.820
Yes, good night.

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:20.360
Saen, how are you?

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:25.200
I'm much better now.

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:34.740
Khun Yai, what will happen if Khun Kaew
meditates and can recall his past life?

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.360
He should be able to
remember everything soon.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:54.020
Who's there?

00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:58.760
Kaew.

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:08.340
Khun Yai! Are you in here?

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.500
I'm worried about you.

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:14.930
Are you safe?

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:35.000
Why did you come back?

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:42.130
Khun Yai.

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:46.380
I'm right in front of you.
Can't you see me now?

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.580
Please stop, Kaewta.
If you keep doing this,

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:12.860
you'll be in danger.

00:30:56.300 --> 00:31:03.530
Khun Yai!

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:28.500
Stop it! Don't disappoint
Father any further!

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:47.500
Khun Kaew! Get Khun Yai and run away!

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:51.130
Let's go, Khun Yai.

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:02.660
Go after him!

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:04.580
Khun Prom!

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:09.420
Don't even think.

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:30.220
Where did he go?

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:00.460
Khun Yai.

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:02.900
I'll be fine.

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:07.676
I'll take you back to your place.

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:09.580
No, you can't.

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:14.740
If people know that I got
ambushed, it will ruin the big plan.

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:19.700
Then, what do you want me to do?

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:30.620
I guess we have to go there.

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.300
Go where?

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:42.420
Please be careful. Let's sit down first.

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:50.260
Are you all right?

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:53.940
I'm fine.

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:57.860
Let me see the wound.

00:34:28.659 --> 00:34:30.500
You're lucky it's not that deep.

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:36.730
You'll find some medicine in that chest.

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:44.219
Saen and I built this cottage
to use during a secret operation.

00:34:44.699 --> 00:34:47.620
We store some medicine and
basic supplies in case of emergency.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.400
Is it this one?

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:12.700
Please forgive me for
dragging you into this mess.

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:16.340
Who are they?

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:20.020
Probably those who get angry…

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:24.220
Because I've tried to expose
the evil things they are doing.

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:34.300
Thank you for staying by my side.

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:39.560
Yes.

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:52.400
Please stay still.

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:02.600
Your hands are freezing.
Are you sure you're all right?

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:06.560
I'm fine indeed.

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:26.900
Maybe, we should change our clothes a bit.

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.900
No fever, that's good.

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:55.260
You look at me as if I
were something strange.

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:02.600
I'm sorry.

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:15.860
I need to ask you something.

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:20.860
What is it?

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:36.180
I almost got killed this time.
The pain from that blade…

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:45.500
Has reminded me…how life is so short.

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.980
Too short to keep all
these feelings inside.

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:57.700
I'm afraid I won't have
a chance to tell you later.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000
Yes.

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.500
I love you, Kaewta.

00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:30.060
Love?

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:36.060
Even though I'm not a lady?

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:43.260
The world has set up so many rules
to define what love should be like.

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:48.060
But there are no rules in my heart.

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:52.260
It has no conditions.

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:57.900
Except that it must be you.

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:11.140
I still insist…that love is love.

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:30.600
Khun Yai!

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:45.780
I'll…I'll prepare the bed for you.

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:51.220
You can sleep inside. I'll sleep out here.

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:22.180
Still not back, Miss.

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:26.730
What? Brother and Saen haven't
come home since last night?

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:28.196
That's right, Miss.

00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:31.536
I heard Nanny Yam tell
your father that, Miss.

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:33.460
Nanny Yam, tell Tiang to get the car ready.

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:34.700
Yes, My Lord.

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.660
Tiang, get the car now!

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:37.760
Father.

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:40.500
I know. I'm taking our
men to look for them.

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:45.000
Why don't you try Luang
Sanor's place, Father?

00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:52.060
Khun Phra Nai often goes there lately. I
wonder what he finds so interesting there.

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:55.020
Perhaps, the dancer maybe.

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:57.500
At Luang Sanor's place?

00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:01.500
Father! I'll go with you.

00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:03.300
Let's go.

00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:06.477
Stay here!

00:44:06.501 --> 00:44:07.600
Yes, Miss.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:17.420
Just get on with your work, Som.

00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:18.037
Go!

00:44:18.061 --> 00:44:19.380
Yes, Master!

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:30.500
But Khun Prom, our man
has just informed that…

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:33.100
Khun Yai isn't at Luang Sanor's place.

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:35.530
That's why.

00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:39.560
That's why I must divert Father's
and Sophee's attention to that place.

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:41.700
Boon.

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:42.900
Yes, sir.

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:48.420
Go tell our men to keep watch
on every route back to this house.

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:54.196
If anyone sees that brat, just kill
him and come get the prize from me.

00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:55.220
Yes, sir.

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.940
What the heck was I thinking?

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:02.700
Kaew.

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:40.700
There you are.

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:44.560
Khun Yai.

00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:46.940
I want to have a bath too.

00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:09.060
Is it hurt?

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:16.000
Getting hurt this
time…isn't so bad after all.

00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:22.960
Your wound is fatal. How
could you say it wasn't that bad?

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.556
At least, it makes me know…

00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:30.980
How much you care about me.

00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:38.140
If I get to see you like this every morning
when I wake up, it'd surely be nice.

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:47.360
That's impossible.

00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:06.100
As long as we love each other like
this, I'm sure we'll be able to find a way.

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:13.500
Have you…

00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:18.020
Forgotten about last night?

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:27.120
You won't get hurt if you
don't try it in the first place.

00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:31.460
I think we should stop here.

00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:38.180
But Kaew…what about last night?

00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:39.880
Hurry up and finish washing, Khun Yai.

00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:43.900
I'll make something for you to
eat, then we can go back home.

00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:46.560
Kaew!

00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:16.000
Khun Yai!

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000
Khun Yai!

00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:22.660
Saen.

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:24.200
Khun Yai!

00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:27.930
- Saen.
- Saen.

00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:30.800
I knew you two must be here.

00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:32.700
How are you?

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:34.200
Are you hurt?

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:37.600
Those minions can't hurt me, sir.

00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:39.960
I got it, you're great.

00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:43.156
Anyway, sir.

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:45.556
You and Khun Kaew should hurry home now.

00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:48.220
Everyone is worrying sick looking for you.

00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:59.780
We've searched every dancer's
house but still couldn't find Kaew.

00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:06.980
Oh, dear. He's also not at Luang Sanor's.
We have no idea if he's dead or alive.

00:50:10.375 --> 00:50:20.375

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:13.200
Mum!

00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:14.036
Mum!

00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:14.776
Kaew!

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:15.800
Kaew!

00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:17.700
Kaew!

00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:20.396
My dear, are you all right?

00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:21.620
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:23.356
I'm fine, Mum.

00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:25.020
Where have you been?

00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:27.700
We've been looking for you since yesterday.

00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:31.060
Khun Phra Nai.

00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:35.220
Oh my goodness.

00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:37.100
- Kan, stop!
- Kan.

00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:40.220
Khun Phra Nai is the one who saved me.

00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:43.760
What happened, dear?

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.820
Well…

00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:53.580
I ran into him on his way to Luang Sanor's
place. But then, we got ambushed by the bandits.

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:55.260
Good grief!

00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:03.220
Khun Phra Nai got hurt from saving me.

00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:06.536
We ran away and decided
to hide for a while, Mum.

00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:07.660
Who are those bandits?

00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:10.676
Why did they want to rob you, Kaew?

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:15.820
I think you're actually not their target.

00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:20.900
All right there.

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:28.620
I can't thank you enough,
Khun Phra Nai, for saving Kaew.

00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:32.700
Don't worry, it's what I should do anyway.

00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:39.396
Oh, he means…

00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:43.100
It's also the royal guard's duty to oversee
the safety and well-being of the King's people.

00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:47.000
If there's nothing now, we'd
be taking our leave then.

00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:49.660
Let's go, sir.

00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:52.700
Well…I… Saen!

00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:54.340
Let's go, sir.

00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:01.740
Are you all right, Kaew?

00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:05.860
My poor baby. Are you hurt anywhere?

00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:07.730
I'm fine now, Mum.

00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:14.180
You're safe now, dear.

00:52:15.930 --> 00:52:17.620
That was close, Khun Yai!

00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:19.730
I don't see why I have to hide it.

00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:23.220
I actually want Miss Payom
to know how I feel about Kaew.

00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:25.220
What?

00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:28.200
Has Khun Kaew accepted your feelings, sir?

00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:32.700
He also feels the same
as I do, I'm sure about that.

00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:35.500
I'll do everything to win him over.

00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:38.400
Suit yourself then.

00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:40.660
But right now, we should hurry home.

00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:42.700
I'm afraid it's total chaos there.

00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:46.100
Wait, Saen.

00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:48.330
What?

00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:54.300
On our way back, Prom must've
definitely sent someone to ambush on us.

00:52:55.930 --> 00:52:57.460
We should take the secret route.

00:52:58.960 --> 00:52:59.960
Yes, sir.

00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:16.130
There they are!

00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:18.100
My Lord.

00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:21.760
My dear miss.

00:53:22.930 --> 00:53:24.560
Have you found them, Father?

00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:29.930
Brother didn't go there. And
Uncle also has no idea where he is.

00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:34.316
Poor Khun Yai. Poor Saen.

00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:38.540
Where are they now?
Please let them be all right.

00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:50.260
Khun Yai and I won't
die so easily, Nanny Yam.

00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:56.180
Father.

00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:00.940
Brother!

00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:07.400
Where have you been, Brother?

00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:12.620
Where did you get all these clothes from?

00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:19.260
Where have you been, Yai?
Why are you back just now?

00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:35.636
[NEXT EPISODE]
People at the market are talking, Miss.

00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:39.116
That Khun Phra Nai is now infatuated
with a dancer from Luang Sanor's place.

00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:44.316
Lady Sophee is here to
select dancers to perform…

00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:47.140
At the Queen Mother's banquet.

00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:49.700
I'll have this one.

00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:52.716
Thank you, Miss.

00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:54.236
What happened, Ruedee?

00:54:54.260 --> 00:54:55.660
Is that blood?

00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:59.436
What did you say? They're
planning to assassinate His Majesty?

00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:01.540
No one else knows about this.

00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:06.036
Please keep it between us only, Father.

00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:09.596
That brat already knew about us.
We can't stick to our old plan now.

00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:13.540
If he's dead, his people will
have a reason to attack us.

00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:25.300
We're together all day today.

00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:25.717
That's right.

00:55:25.741 --> 00:55:27.516
- We're filming together today.
- Yes.

00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:28.836
That's because we'll
be investigating a case.

00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:33.596
Khun Phra Nai and Luang
Sanor are…secret agents.

00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:39.196
Like that scene earlier, we sent someone
on a secret mission but he got attacked.

00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:41.876
- Yeah, he's injured. A spy, right?
- Yes, a spy.

00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:44.796
- I sent him to spy on the association, but he got caught.
- A spy.

00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:48.820
But suddenly, Prom shows
up. Something is fishy here.

00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:50.660
So, please wait and see.

00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:52.316
Let them set up the cameras first.

00:55:52.340 --> 00:55:55.100
They are all over there, at
the pavilion. Wanna go there?

00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:57.260
Let's go. It's quite cool in there.

00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:04.340
Here they are. Say something.

00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:05.540
Hi there.

00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:07.780
- What are you guys doing?
- Hello, Saen.

00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:09.500
We're waiting.

00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:13.876
What were you talking about earlier? Did you
mention something about Prom? What was that?

00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:15.740
- Prom? He is…
- What did he do?

00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:18.620
It's our spy. He got attacked.

00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:24.156
Then Prom appears out of nowhere. But
he doesn't usually do this kind of thing,

00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:25.636
visiting and giving gifts to the elders.

00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:31.940
- Oh! That's fishy.
- Yeah, very fishy…And then Chao Mu..Chao Mi…

00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:35.636
That's it. Now, we'll
shoot from another angle.

00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:38.660
They're moving the cameras
outside to shoot back inside.

00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:41.260
And then this scene will be done.

00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:45.676
We had to stand quite close to
each other because there was…

00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:48.356
- Very little space.
- Our noses almost touched. So close.

00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:51.580
Sounds romantic but you guys were
actually biting each other's head off.

00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:55.660
I see Khun Phra Nai coming to
visit this place almost every day.

00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:57.676
So, I'm quite curious.

00:56:57.700 --> 00:57:02.820
Father said his adopted son
often comes here to bother you.

00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:07.740
So, he'd like to return
the gratitude somehow.

00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:15.180
You're back?

00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:17.540
Yes, Uncle.

00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:19.700
Very well then.

00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:22.437
Kaew.

00:57:22.461 --> 00:57:23.620
Oh! Kaew.

00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:34.660
Prom.

00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:40.940
How could you say it so easily?

00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:43.340
Why make it difficult?

00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:47.540
Kaew!

00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:53.860
Action!

00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:03.820
Khun Yai! Khun Yai…

00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:09.180
Finally, some action scenes for me.

00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:10.740
Waiting.

00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:34.540
Please stop. Don't
disappoint Father any further.

00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:39.060
You're lucky it's not that deep.

00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:42.180
But the bleeding hasn't stopped yet.

00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:45.940
He's injured.

00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:49.140
Ouch, that hurts.

00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:51.180
So fake. Kaew, it hurts.

00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:55.740
If it were me, I'd pinch
the wound until it's torn.

00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:57.660
Ouch. Now, the other side hurts.

00:58:59.460 --> 00:59:01.236
- The other side?
- Yes, the other side.

00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:05.140
Geez, Kaew! Do you also carry an aesthetic?

00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:09.100
- Eat that.
- Eat that, yeah.

00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:11.036
He's so cagey.

00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:15.356
We're running away from the bandits.

00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:17.780
Yeah. You must be aching then.

00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:20.716
What a hit.

00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:22.916
Mosquitoes and insects
seem to stay clear from me.

00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:24.740
All because of his killer hands.

00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:28.340
Always fooling around. So,
we ran away…to hide here.

00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:30.380
But I want to do more than that.

00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:34.140
Seriously, Kaewta is too naive.

00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:39.860
I lure you here, to the secret
hideout that only me and Saen…

00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:42.220
- Oh.
- …know about it.

00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:46.180
Seems suspicious.

♫ Still miss all those times, even
when our love can never be the same ♫

♫ But I can never forget about us ♫

♫ No matter how much time has passed ♫

01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:07.156
♫ I'm still the same, still
missing you with all my heart ♫

01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:12.436
♫ Every time when the night is falling ♫

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:17.980
♫ My mind keeps worrying
how you are doing ♫

01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:23.276
♫ No matter how much time has passed ♫

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:28.516

missing you with all my heart ♫
