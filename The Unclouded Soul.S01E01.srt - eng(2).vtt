[The Unclouded Soul]

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.759
[Episode 1]

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.920
[Since the beginning of time,]

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.840
[legends have told of
a celestial mountain]

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.150
[with a spring called Yuli.]

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.259
[Humans who drink it gain immortality,]

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.289
[while demons
gain 1,000 years of cultivation.]

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.590
[However,
this mountain drifts between sea and sky.]

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.000
[Only with the guidance
of the ancient Kunlun Mirror]

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.870
[can one be led there.]

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.710
[Humans and demons alike
have been trying to find it]

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.870
[relentlessly.]

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.680
[Among them, the emperors of the
Tiancheng Kingdom were the most obsessed,]

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.960
[even sending seven costly expeditions.]

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.790
The celestial mountain?

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.810
[Emperor of Tiansheng Kingdom]

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.790
The divine has blessed me.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.329
This must be Yuli Spring.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.420
[Dreamshard Immortal]

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.690
Greetings, Exalted Immortal.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.020
Thank you for granting me Yuli.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.200
What you see

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.190
is merely an illusion.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.800
To find the true Yuli Spring,

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.780
you need the guidance of the Kunlun Mirror

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.150
to find the path
to the celestial mountain.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.060
Please enlighten me, Exalted Immortal.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.820
You're the Emperor, who is supreme.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.680
Others are of no concern,

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.030
except Hong Ye, the Monarch of All Demons.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.840
But Hong Ye was

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.840
destroyed by our ancestors 100 years ago.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.579
He is merely lying dormant.

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.860
If he drinks from Yuli Spring first

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.060
and regains his powers,

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:44.920
in this world,

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.579
no one will be able to match him.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.020
Remember this face.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.810
[Hong Ye]

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.920
If you want to live forever,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.910
you must step over my dead body!

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.800
Yuli Spring...

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.510
Your Majesty,

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.430
what's wrong?

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.070
His Majesty
was tormented by nightmares at night,

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.409
and the Feiyu Guard failed to protect him.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.740
All Feiyu Guards,
assemble outside the side hall

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.720
for punishment

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.750
The late emperor
established the Feiyu Guard

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.550
to eliminate demons in the capital.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.830
And now,

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.800
in your time,

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.130
demons have invaded my bedchamber!

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.159
Your Majesty, please calm your anger!

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:00.600
I deserve death!

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.100
Should I keep the Feiyu Guard,

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.000
or should I keep you as the Demon Slayer?

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.930
Your Majesty!

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.110
Your Majesty!

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:13.430
Your Majesty!

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.180
Please forgive me, Your Majesty!

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.390
Please spare my life, Your Majesty!

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.190
Which one is Bingzhu?

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:30.360
I am...

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:32.140
Bingzhu.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.800
[Bingzhu]

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.310
From today onward,

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.750
you will take over as the Demon Slayer
of the Feiyu Guard.

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.730
With this token,
you can command all provinces

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.280
[Demon Slayer of the Feiyu Guard]

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.040
to assist the Feiyu Guard

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.230
in eliminating evil demons.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.430
I-I, Bingzhu,

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.659
obey your command.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.720
Bingzhu, Demon Slayer of the Feiyu Guards,

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.320
enter the hall
to receive the imperial decree!

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.580
Thank you, sir.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.270
It's 9PM!

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.600
Lock your doors and windows,

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.140
keep your family safe,

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.430
and beware of demons!

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.159
Mom,

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:42.880
why can't we go outside after dark?

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.360
Because when it gets dark,

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.020
demons come out to eat people.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.409
Mom.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.870
The demons you talk about—

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.720
do they look like this?

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.950
Little rascal, go to sleep.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.870
Demon! Demon!

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.610
Demon!

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.710
[Xiao Yao]

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.380
Keep your family safe!

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.600
It's 9PM!

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.160
Lock your doors and windows,

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.480
keep your family safe,

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.390
and beware of demons!

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:15.610
Demon!

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:18.600
Don't be afraid!

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.730
I will surely capture that bear demon!

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.510
A sorcerer is catching demons!

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.630
Everyone, come and help catch the demon!

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:26.270
Hurry!

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:27.740
Where is it?

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:39.900
My Lord,

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.299
since the demon has appeared,

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:42.030
[Ji Yan]

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:43.480
should we use the Feiyu token

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.080
to call for reinforcements?

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.200
My demon-slaying blade hasn't alerted me.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:48.800
Why panic?

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:49.550
Where is it?

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:50.680
Where is it?

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:51.600
Where's the demon?

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.660
Where's the demon?

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:55.240
Everyone, rest assured.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.320
Now that I've taken action,

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.240
victory is certain. Follow me!

00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:58.670
Let's go!

00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:59.240
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.170
Catch the demon!

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.630
Hurry! This way!

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:04.430
Don't let the bear demon escape!

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:05.870
It's the curfew hour.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:06.840
Who's there?

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:09.150
Officer,

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:11.150
I am a demon hunter from Jiwei Mountain.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:12.650
I've been chasing a bear demon
all the way here.

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:14.150
Please do me a favor

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:15.410
and open the city gate.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.770
Closing the city gates at night
is the law.

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:17.790
[Pingjiang Prefecture]

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:19.190
No one may enter or leave.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.550
The bear demon is violent by nature

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:21.720
and has hurt countless people.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.390
If it returns to Pingjiang Prefecture
to cause harm,

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:25.320
what good will closing the gates do?

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.220
That's right!

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:28.240
The officials have their own judgment.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:28.960
Master,

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.640
please don't make things difficult for us.

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:33.150
Heroine,

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.870
if you leave the city now,

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.270
the demon will turn back,

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:37.750
and the ones who suffer

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:39.200
will be common folk like us.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:39.780
Yes, yes!

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.570
Please stay, heroine!

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.290
Please stay, heroine!

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:46.530
-Stay!
-Stay!

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.160
Protect us, heroine!

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.450
Please stay!

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:52.910
Stay, heroine!

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.060
Make way! Make way!

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.210
The Prefect is here!

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.840
Set down the sedan.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.970
Set down the sedan! Set down the sedan!

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.150
Master,

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:06.940
I've prepared excellent food and wine
at my residence.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:07.200
[Prefect]

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.030
Please stay at my house for a few days.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.360
Yes, yes.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.150
But...

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.480
Master, may I have a word with you?

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:22.720
Go!

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:23.200
Go!

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.280
To be honest with you, Master,

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.240
I have two daughters

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.570
at home.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.910
They've heard about
the recent demon attacks

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:32.550
and haven't eaten
or slept properly for days.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:34.790
They're often distracted and anxious.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:37.080
I hope you can help us.

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:40.060
I appreciate your kindness,

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:42.020
but if I don't eliminate the bear demon,

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.980
what if it returns to harm the people?

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.830
What should we do if the bear demon
comes back?

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.210
-Master! You can't leave!
-You can't leave us alone.

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:49.940
Shut up! Shut up!

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.900
Who are you to speak here?

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.760
If you take the Master home,

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.360
-who will protect us common folk?
-Stop making such a fuss!

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.220
How about this?

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.030
I have

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.440
some talismans here.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:03.080
Place them on your doors and windows,

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.000
and they will prevent demons
from approaching.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.270
You can also carry them with you.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:07.390
Recite the incantation,

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:09.390
and it will keep demons at bay.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.390
Today,

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:12.260
I'll give them to you.

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:13.340
Master,

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:16.720
I heard that others' talismans
are quite expensive.

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:18.510
You're giving these away for free.

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.720
Will they actually work?

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.000
How rude!

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.360
These were given to me

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.690
by my master for protection before I left.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:29.330
Talk about ingratitude!

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:30.360
So ungrateful.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.280
Forget it then.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.510
I'll take them all.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.120
Name your price, Master.

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:37.990
I'll pay 5 coins!

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.030
10 coins!

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:40.340
I'll pay 60 coins!

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.000
Why is he bidding up the price?

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:45.760
I'll pay 1 tael!

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.000
That's too much.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.130
I can't afford that.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:49.240
Everyone,

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:51.120
since fate has brought us together today,

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.320
I'll create a bond of goodwill with you.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:55.880
I'll sell this talisman

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:58.530
for one coin a piece. Is that all right?

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:01.570
No need to rush! Don't push!

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.240
Pay the money and you'll get one!

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:03.870
You just need to pay!

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:04.960
Don't push!

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:06.860
Stop pushing!

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.390
There's enough for everyone!

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:15.920
I've been hunting demons for years,

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:18.550
but today I've truly opened my eyes.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.550
I didn't know you were here, sir.

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:22.630
Forgive me for not greeting you properly.

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:23.630
Please accept my apologies.

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:25.160
Please step back, Prefect.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.520
I'd like to have

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:29.640
a word with this female Master.

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:31.670
I'm Bingzhu,

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:33.120
[Demon Slayer of the Feiyu Guard]

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.920
Demon Slayer of the Feiyu Guard.

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:40.340
So you're Master Bingzhu.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.260
May I ask your name

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:44.910
and which immortal sect you belong to?

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:46.720
We focus on quiet cultivation.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.270
To avoid worldly distractions,

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:49.630
I cannot disclose that information.

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:50.870
Please understand.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.200
This seems to be fur

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.060
that fell off that demon just now.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.120
It is bear fur,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.170
but since it hasn't been nourished
by blood,

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:14.700
it has long since dried out.

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.590
Perhaps it was scorched by my fire whip.

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:18.910
That makes sense.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.690
But this footprint

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:28.380
doesn't match the size of that bear demon.

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:30.080
That bear demon

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.620
was massive,

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:34.050
weighing between 150 and 250 kilograms,

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.080
but this footprint looks like...

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.150
it's from something
barely over 50 kilograms—

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:39.630
more like a human.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.380
Master,

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:44.830
what's your opinion?

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.150
Fifty-fifty?

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:02.720
All of it.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.230
Forty-sixty?

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.650
-You get sixty, and I get forty.
-I told you.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.030
All of it.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.030
The Feiyu Guard has been
watching over the city this whole time,

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:18.510
and not a single fly has gotten out,

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.550
which means the demon...

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.120
is still inside the city.

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:28.750
What exactly do you want?

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:35.610
Feiyu Guards came here

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.900
to catch the demon.

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:39.120
But this female master

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.720
accidentally let it escape.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.580
Fortunately, the Feiyu Guard...

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:46.150
didn't fail its mission.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:47.120
Move!

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:47.530
Move!

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:48.960
Behave yourself!

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:51.840
Move!

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:52.390
Move!

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:54.000
It's a human!

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:54.750
It's a human!

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:55.630
It's a human!

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.670
It's a human!

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:58.360
Daughter,

00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.000
[Xiao Dadan]

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.130
we've been exposed!

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:01.020
Frauds!

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.240
I've had my eyes on you from the start.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.390
Still trying to run?

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:14.200
Beware!

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.000
[Justice of the World]

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.720
Beware!

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.700
Please, sir.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:37.910
Have a seat.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:39.510
Sit.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.720
[Righteousness]

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.950
Swindler, state your names!

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.440
Bring cold water here

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:50.680
to wake her up.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:51.790
Cold water.

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:52.320
Yes.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:56.960
Where am I?

00:15:59.000 --> 00:15:59.960
Officer?

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:03.750
-Dad?
-Daughter.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.460
-You insolent criminal!
-You...

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.080
You are extremely brazen.

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:12.030
This is the magistrate's office,

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:14.320
not a place for your theatrics!

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:16.960
My name is Xiao Yao.

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:19.140
This is my father, Xiao Dadan.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.170
Those people are from my hometown.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.870
We were originally hunters.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.600
But several months ago,

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.320
the magistrate's office suddenly ordered
us to catch demons within a deadline.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.520
How do we know how to catch demons?

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:31.080
We had no choice

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.000
but to leave our hometown.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.390
Out of desperation,

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:38.270
we risked our lives to hunt a bear

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:40.410
and used its skin

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:41.960
-to pretend to be a demon.
-Troublemakers.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:42.720
Menaces!

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.600
So you're the ones
behind the demon disturbances in the city!

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:48.610
You caused my daughter...

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.910
You caused my daughter mental fatigue

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:56.920
and the people of this city
are living in fear.

00:16:58.070 --> 00:16:58.770
Officer,

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:00.870
I know I was wrong.

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.840
But we have never harmed anyone.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.400
We're just asking for a chance to live.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:04.920
Please judge us fairly.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:05.920
[Righteousness]

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:06.910
Judge?

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:08.640
We caught you red-handed.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.200
Guards!

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.440
Take this female swindler to prison

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.750
to await execution!

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:14.280
And give the others 50 strokes each!

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.280
I'd like to see

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:17.109
who dares spread rumors again

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:19.310
about demons in this prefecture.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:20.400
My Lord! My Lord!

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:22.589
My daughter may be reckless

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:23.920
and deserving of death,

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:24.880
but I beg you

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.240
to spare her life.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.680
Take them away! Take them away!

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.310
My Lord!

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.210
Let me go!

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:32.510
I've returned all the money.

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:33.750
Why must you take my life?

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:35.010
You corrupt official!

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:36.110
You can't catch demons;

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:37.590
all you know is killing people.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:38.310
And you!

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.240
Demon Slayer of the Feiyu Guard?

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.160
You use the name of demon hunting

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.240
to bleed the people dry

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.960
and collude with this corrupt official.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:44.450
And now

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.880
you want to take our lives
to earn credit with your superiors.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.030
If I die, will that make the demons

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:49.200
in this city disappear?

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.400
Outrageous! Outrageous.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.790
Guards! Gag her

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:53.000
and drag her out!

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.570
-I'm telling...
-Wait.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.560
I think you made a good point.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:04.930
By killing,

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.010
we can't catch any demons.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.310
But what if the one I kill

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.350
is actually a demon?

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:24.070
This is the compass

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:26.370
the Feiyu Guard uses for hunting demons.

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:27.790
When a demon is near,

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:29.350
the bead inside moves

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:32.550
and helps us

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:34.870
locate it.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.270
From the city gate
to the magistrate's office,

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:48.530
you've been spinning stories all night.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.880
Now honestly tell us your true identity.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.290
Since it's come to this,

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.730
I'll tell you the truth.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.400
I am a demon.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.320
A nine-tailed fox demon.

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:15.480
Go ahead, kill me,

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.880
and go claim your credit.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.320
Since you're so eager to die,

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.710
I'll grant your wish!

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:22.310
My Lord!

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.100
My Lord!

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:24.280
Please don't!

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.080
Let me explain on her behalf.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.550
My daughter

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:29.400
is indeed different from others.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.330
Her blood carries a peculiar scent

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:34.750
that attracts snakes, insects,
and other foul creatures.

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:37.000
People may mistake her for a demon,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.250
but she isn't.

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:41.630
Many people came to my home,
splashed dog's blood,

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.750
drove us from place to place, and hunted
and reviled us wherever we went.

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.070
But she's not a demon.

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:49.220
She... she was born from my wife.

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:50.320
She's human.

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:51.000
Human!

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:52.880
So her blood

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.770
can attract demons?

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:57.160
Wait...

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.500
Since that's the case,

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.230
I shall use you as bait
to lure out the true demons.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.530
Once we catch a great demon,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.260
I'll release them all.

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:15.130
What do you say?

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:20.840
You said it yourself.

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:22.430
I hope you keep your word.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.440
Set up the formation!

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:04.230
This is the heart of Qingyuan Mountain,

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.970
a place filled with demonic energy
for 100 years.

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:09.480
We read the stars and predicted

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.610
that a great demon would appear today.

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:14.530
We didn't expect you to suddenly show up.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:17.830
You...

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:19.430
Don't pull me.

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:20.720
You...

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.080
Miss,

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:27.470
I'm sorry about this.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.310
What are you doing?

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.240
If what your father said is true,

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.510
that the peculiar scent in your blood
can attract demons,

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:37.840
then this will count as you making amends.

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:39.960
I'll cooperate with you until dawn.

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:40.590
Tomorrow at 5 in the morning,

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:41.830
whether a great demon appears or not,

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:43.310
you must let us go.

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:49.720
It hurts.

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:53.600
We'll see by then.

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:21.460
My Lord,

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.590
this girl only has a sharp tongue.

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:24.750
Can we trust her?

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.420
The compass reacts
when it gets close to her,

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.720
which means she's not an ordinary person.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.200
But my demon-slaying blade didn't warn me,

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:34.880
so she's not a demon.

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:36.880
She's neither human nor a demon,

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.940
so she must have some unusual traits.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.300
Today is the 15th day of the 7th month,

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:44.480
when yin and yang shift
and demonic energy peaks.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.920
Xiao's wilderness survival rule No. 9:

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.980
at night, always stay off the ground.

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.750
Officials claim there are demons

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:24.350
to embezzle money.

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:26.000
Commoners claim there are demons

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.880
just to scare their children.

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:30.440
Great demons are not that easy to find.

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:25.310
Be patient.

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:29.010
This is no ordinary great demon.

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:35.550
This time, I've truly found a treasure.

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.440
You want this?

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.160
You...

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.000
Step back.

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:10.000
Catch it.

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:25.030
The Zhu Jiuyin lineage?

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:27.270
Attack.

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:27.830
Yes.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:30.880
I'll give it to you.

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:31.590
Let's see

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:32.950
who catches it first.

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:42.390
[Seal]

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.370
The great demon has appeared.

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:07.700
You should let me go now.

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:09.190
It's not time yet.

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:25.480
Why did you try to kill it?

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:27.950
Didn't you see
it was trying to kill people?

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.310
It had no intention to kill people.

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:30.750
If you hadn't
activated the formation first,

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:32.030
it wouldn't have become so agitated.

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:33.400
My Lord, please help us!

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.000
We can't hold on much longer!

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:25.920
Come back!

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:26.960
It's dangerous!

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.660
Catch her!

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:35.640
Let me go!

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:36.640
Your lord said

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.480
he'd let me go once the demon appeared.

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.080
How can he go back on his word?

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:41.410
Miss!

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:56.000
Ning'an!

00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:57.470
How dare you come back?

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:10.240
You're not Ning'an.

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:12.830
[Xiao Ming/Xiao Mu]

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:15.360
Ning'an wouldn't
let herself smell this bad.

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.430
You smell bad! Your mouth stinks.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.180
It's been 100 years.

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:23.240
You still won't let go of His Lordship?

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:23.880
What?

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.340
Give me back His Lordship!

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:26.950
Don't catch me!

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.030
Don't run!

00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:58.490
Give me back His Lordship!

00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:16.280
Are you in a hurry to die?

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:17.550
Come back here!

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:24.750
Stop right there!

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:43.720
She's a fallen immortal.

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:44.510
Don't look at her!

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:46.240
Don't fall for her charm spell!

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.570
Monarch of All Demons?

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:38.230
You have finally appeared.

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:49.030
Ning'an.

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:55.070
You still won't let me go.

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:33.880
Hong Ye,

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:36.880
soon I'll make you come to find me.

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:41.350
Sir.

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:43.239
According to the hexagrams...

00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:48.670
My Lord,

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:51.230
so many of our brothers
were injured this time,

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:52.840
but we still didn't catch the great demon.

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.370
Could we use the Feiyu token

00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:57.190
to request more provincial troops
for reinforcement?

00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:59.710
Provincial troops
are fine for catching people.

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:01.370
If we send them to hunt demons,

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:04.850
they'll just be walking to their deaths.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.480
But that great demon is no ordinary one.

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:10.340
If we don't eliminate it quickly,

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:12.110
I'm afraid a disaster will happen.

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:14.170
Great demons are hard to find anyway.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.480
Let's stop searching for now.

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.140
Let's wait for it to come to us.

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:38.760
My Lord!

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:44.660
Thank goodness!

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.190
My Lord, you have finally woken up!

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:47.320
Heaven has shown mercy.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.960
I've been waiting for you day and night,

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.470
and you're finally back!

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:51.220
My Lord,

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.920
please look at me carefully.

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.550
Transform into Xiao Mu first.

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:55.370
My Lord...

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.410
I want to see him.

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.840
My Lord, you...

00:35:58.070 --> 00:35:58.590
Three,

00:35:58.840 --> 00:35:59.280
two...

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.360
Alright, alright.

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:14.030
My Lord?

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:16.510
Greetings,

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:18.630
My Lord.

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.800
It was that human girl

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:31.360
who awakened me?

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.230
Yes.

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.190
Get away!

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:41.590
Don't come over!

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:42.440
It's bad enough you kidnapped me.

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:43.700
Don't come any closer!

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:44.920
I'll eat you!

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.920
Stay back!

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.190
Hello there.

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.920
I was forced to come to Qingyuan Mountain.

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:55.880
I meant no offense.

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.760
Please let me go.

00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:59.300
