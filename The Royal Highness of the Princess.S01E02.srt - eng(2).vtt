00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.599
Xiao Lizi

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.159
Is the Fifth Princess really...

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:48.519
...want to know?

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.879
Same as always.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.799
Tell us, tell us!

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:56.719
The Imperial Hospital is in total chaos now.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.200
They say there's no cure.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.120
His Majesty had to order Lord Yuwen to search far and wide for a skilled doctor.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.280
...to treat the Fifth Princess.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.239
Will she be like this for the rest of her life?

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.719
What was the Fifth Princess usually like?

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.759
Everyone knows.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.919
If she could stay foolish for life,

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.639
it might not be a bad thing.

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:15.599
Trouble comes from the mouth.

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.199
Be careful someone doesn't hear you.

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:19.240
Don't worry.

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:19.919
It's so early in the morning.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.520
Who would come to such a remote place?

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:22.360
True.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.800
What do you think...

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.039
...could this matter be related to the Grand Chancellor?

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.840
I heard the death of that Imperial Hospital servant was also...

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.840
...discussing the Grand Chancellor behind his back.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.560
Don't you value your lives?

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.280
The way I see it,

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:37.039
all the palace maids and eunuchs right now

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.439
must be secretly rejoicing.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.599
With the Fifth Princess in that state,

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.039
our lives

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.680
will finally be a bit easier.

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.599
I must burn a few more incense sticks for all the gods.

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:48.319
After being in the palace for so long,

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:50.360
I've finally encountered such a great piece of good fortune.

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:51.159
Yes.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.080
Wonderful! It must be my parents who died young

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.280
watching over me, ensuring my wishes come true.

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:56.919
I only pray that heavenly blessings descend,

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.159
making everything go as I wish.

00:02:58.439 --> 00:02:59.000
Who's there?

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.560
Fifth Princess!

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.120
Fifth Princess, spare us!

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.199
Fifth Princess, have mercy!

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:19.120
The grapes are gone.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.000
This servant understands.

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.840
Fifth Princess,

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.719
look.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.719
Is this enough?

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:38.840
I never thought

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:40.560
that I, all by myself,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.199
would raise the happiness index of the entire palace.

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:48.000
Should we award you a Medal of Outstanding Contribution?

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.360
Rather than giving me some award,

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:51.719
you'd be better off telling me:

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.800
Was it Yuwen Rui who poisoned her?

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.879
Yes.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.240
Or no.

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.599
Both are secrets I cannot divulge.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.639
That night,

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.719
what the person in the shadows was looking for

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.919
was definitely the Map of the Nine Provinces.

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.240
It's a pity you still couldn't escape

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.759
the tragic fate of discovering others' secrets.

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:14.159
In the original story,

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.079
the spoiled Fifth Princess secretly left the banquet

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.759
to avoid the marriage arrangement with Yuwen Rui.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.800
And you?

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.839
You were running for your life.

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:23.560
No matter what,

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.399
you couldn't shake off this special trait

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:27.040
inherent to your cannon fodder status.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.319
What trait?

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.800
Through a series of coincidences

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.639
and mishaps,

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.000
regardless of time or place,

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.360
you always discover others' secrets—the Cannon Fodder Constitution.

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.439
The more you know, the sooner you die.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.879
This Cannon Fodder Constitution...

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:41.600
isn't it just trying to get me killed quickly?

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:44.480
After discovering the secret, the original Fifth Princess

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.079
was found by Commander He and brought back to the banquet.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.439
She bumped into a servant carrying a congratulatory gift,

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.279
touched a poisoned porcelain piece,

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:53.879
and was accidentally poisoned.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.759
She kicked the bucket.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.959
But now, this poison

00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:02.319
was placed inside a pill that can cure a hundred poisons.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.120
The other party is quite adaptable, aren't they?

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:57.199
In broad daylight,

00:05:57.959 --> 00:05:59.439
hugging and holding each other...

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.680
This is really...

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:03.439
really...

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:06.639
really a feast for the eyes.

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:16.000
Why did the rain suddenly get heavier?

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:17.439
It totally ruins the mood.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.319
Can't you see the handsome guy and the beauty are cultivating feelings?

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:22.879
You think this rain is an accident?

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.680
To keep them from going back for a while,

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.680
to have a chance to be alone,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.439
this heavy rain was created.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.800
Don't try to fool me.

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:33.040
Isn't there a covered walkway?

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.160
They could just walk along it.

00:06:35.079 --> 00:06:36.319
Why don't you try it and see?

00:06:49.079 --> 00:06:49.879
Alright, alright, alright.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.399
I won't leave, okay?

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.199
I'll wait until they're done cultivating feelings before I go.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.240
I should be out in the rain,

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:02.480
not here,

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.720
watching how sweet they are.

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:08.199
The rain is getting heavier.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.680
Luckily it wasn't heavy on the way here.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.879
Otherwise, we would have gotten soaked.

00:07:14.079 --> 00:07:15.360
This rain seems to have a spirit.

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:17.959
Every time we practice swordplay together,

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.639
it only gets heavy after we reach the pavilion.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.680
It's not a spirit at all.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.000
This is the Protagonist's halo.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.279
That's why you didn't get wet.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.519
If I find a way to join the protagonist team,

00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:35.680
A cannon fodder wants to sneak into the protagonist team?

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.160
Can't you make some noise next time you appear?

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.319
Why do you want to sneak into the protagonist team?

00:07:40.519 --> 00:07:42.120
Don't you understand teamwork?

00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:45.360
I'm a powerless, malicious cannon fodder.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.800
How can I complete various tasks all by myself?

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.439
For a cannon fodder like you,

00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:52.680
it is indeed difficult.

00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:53.399
So,

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.279
teamwork becomes very important at this point.

00:07:57.959 --> 00:08:00.800
If I can form a team with the male and female leads,

00:08:01.079 --> 00:08:04.240
then I'll definitely get twice the result with half the effort.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.120
Fourth Sister.

00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:21.959
Why has A Lan come?

00:08:25.279 --> 00:08:27.480
A Lan came to give Fourth Sister a gift.

00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:30.040
Everything inside is A Lan's treasures.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.480
I'm giving them all to Fourth Sister.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.519
Do you like them?

00:08:43.879 --> 00:08:47.320
This jewelry was originally bestowed upon A Zi by His Majesty.

00:08:47.879 --> 00:08:50.039
But later, you insisted you liked it

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.240
and forcibly took it away.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.240
Xixi says

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.480
Fourth Sister likes to look at these.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.600
These few books are the ones I gave to Azi last year.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.159
But later, Azi said she couldn't find them anywhere.

00:09:11.919 --> 00:09:13.039
And they're actually with you.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:17.960
What is this?

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.240
Speaking of the Fourth Princess of Yunmi,

00:09:24.559 --> 00:09:26.519
she is less than five chi tall,

00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:29.919
cross-eyed, with a bulbous nose,

00:09:30.159 --> 00:09:33.039
her face is hideous, her heart as black as ink.

00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:35.320
Every day in the palace, she fools around with people,

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.480
eunuchs and guards alike.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.039
Fourth Sister, what are you reading?

00:09:39.039 --> 00:09:40.679
This play script of yours doesn't seem to be finished, does it?

00:09:41.639 --> 00:09:42.799
If I'm not mistaken,

00:09:43.559 --> 00:09:44.679
you plan to, after finishing it,

00:09:44.919 --> 00:09:46.320
give it to a storyteller outside the palace.

00:09:50.159 --> 00:09:51.159
A Lan is hungry.

00:09:51.639 --> 00:09:53.759
Going back to eat grapes first.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.440
Thanks to the original body's blessing,

00:10:06.279 --> 00:10:07.720
infiltrating the protagonist group

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.440
is truly a long and arduous road.

00:10:14.679 --> 00:10:15.960
Birds of a feather flock together.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.039
It's understandable that the protagonist group

00:10:18.039 --> 00:10:19.360
is unwilling to accept you.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.360
I said, why are you haunting me like this?

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.240
I came to inform you

00:10:26.799 --> 00:10:27.919
that your next mission

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:31.080
is to save the eunuch Xiao Lizi and Nanny Mo from the Cold Palace.

00:10:31.759 --> 00:10:32.720
According to the original plot,

00:10:33.039 --> 00:10:33.679
in five days,

00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:35.759
Xiao Lizi will die in the library.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.240
Nanny Mo will die in the Cold Palace.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:39.440
By the way,

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.000
Xiao Lizi is the one

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.600
you threw grapes at today.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.679
Good luck to you.

00:11:00.759 --> 00:11:01.159
Princess.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.360
This is the information on Lord Yuwen you requested.

00:11:05.759 --> 00:11:07.679
Isn't this prop a bit too casual?

00:11:08.879 --> 00:11:09.360
Princess,

00:11:09.879 --> 00:11:10.679
properly speaking,

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.080
you should address Lord Yuwen as 'Eldest Cousin'.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.360
Eldest Cousin.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.360
Her Majesty the Empress is Young Master Xiu's aunt.

00:11:19.759 --> 00:11:21.679
You address Young Master Xiu as 'Seventh Cousin'.

00:11:22.039 --> 00:11:24.039
And the Grand Chancellor is Young Master Xiu's cousin.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.039
Therefore, it's only right for you, Princess,

00:11:27.039 --> 00:11:27.720
to address him as 'Eldest Cousin'.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.879
You had some past conflicts with Lord Yuwen.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:42.799
Returning the hairpin

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.639
might make him forgive you, Princess.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.399
That day, when the Princess wanted to return the hairpin to Lord Yuwen,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:50.840
this servant thought

00:11:51.279 --> 00:11:53.960
the Princess had finally realized Lord Yuwen's good qualities.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.720
I didn't expect such a thing to happen again.

00:11:59.159 --> 00:12:00.039
Lord Yuwen.

00:12:02.559 --> 00:12:03.600
Eldest Cousin.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.799
The Fifth Princess has never called me 'Eldest Cousin' before.

00:12:15.679 --> 00:12:16.799
Is the Fifth Princess...

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.200
What on earth did Xixi find?

00:12:42.399 --> 00:12:42.919
My lord,

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:43.679
it was this servant.

00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:44.600
Eldest Cousin,

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.240
I asked Xixi to find them.

00:12:47.879 --> 00:12:50.960
The Fifth Princess is so interested in my affairs?

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.559
Know yourself and know your enemy,

00:12:52.879 --> 00:12:54.080
and you will never be defeated.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.360
Eldest Cousin is handsome.

00:12:56.879 --> 00:12:58.559
A Lan likes Eldest Cousin.

00:13:01.279 --> 00:13:02.360
Has the Fifth Princess forgotten

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.039
how you tried every possible way to cancel the engagement before?

00:13:06.559 --> 00:13:08.159
A Lan likes Eldest Cousin.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.960
Don't cancel the engagement.

00:13:14.039 --> 00:13:17.240
It seems the Fifth Princess has indeed forgotten many things.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.720
You don't remember a thing from the birthday banquet.

00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:30.600
Xixi said

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.840
the hairpin must be returned to Eldest Cousin.

00:13:37.159 --> 00:13:38.279
Does the Fifth Princess still remember

00:13:38.279 --> 00:13:39.639
how you obtained this hairpin?

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.320
You don't remember.

00:13:45.519 --> 00:13:46.279
I remember.

00:13:52.919 --> 00:13:55.000
The Fifth Princess should keep this hairpin for herself.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.279
The miracle doctor is outside.

00:13:58.799 --> 00:13:59.679
When the Fifth Princess is ready,

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:00.720
have someone summon him.

00:14:02.559 --> 00:14:03.039
Princess!

00:14:03.559 --> 00:14:04.360
Lord Yuwen actually

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.080
gave you such an important thing!

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.200
This definitely means he's still willing to marry you!

00:14:09.879 --> 00:14:10.919
Even though you're like this,

00:14:11.279 --> 00:14:13.000
he still hasn't abandoned you.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.399
His feelings for you

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.279
are truly full of kindness.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.240
No.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:19.919
He wants to kill me.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.919
After all the things the Princess did before,

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.559
Lord Yuwen can still let bygones be bygones.

00:14:25.159 --> 00:14:26.120
Rumors all say

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.519
that offending Lord Yuwen

00:14:27.919 --> 00:14:29.159
will never end well.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:31.519
It seems

00:14:31.919 --> 00:14:35.360
they're all just jealous of Lord Yuwen's handsomeness and talent.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.559
In the future, when the Princess marries into the Yuwen residence,

00:14:39.279 --> 00:14:41.080
and later has a child or two,

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:41.840
Miracle doctor!

00:14:43.559 --> 00:14:44.559
This servant will go invite him right away.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.120
Princess, don't be afraid.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.320
Rou'er is not poisonous.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.799
I use it for treatment.

00:15:11.279 --> 00:15:11.799
Princess,

00:15:12.399 --> 00:15:16.039
this servant heard this miracle doctor was formerly a coroner.

00:15:22.039 --> 00:15:22.600
Princess,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.080
This miracle doctor has tasted hundreds of herbs,

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:25.840
and

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.919
poisoned himself mute.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.200
My Rou'er! Rou'er!

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.440
What illness are you treating?

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.960
My Rou'er is missing!

00:15:48.639 --> 00:15:49.279
What's going on?

00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:50.919
My lord!

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.600
The matter is like this...

00:15:54.399 --> 00:15:57.519
Only the most skilled can treat A Lan.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:08.120
What?

00:16:08.399 --> 00:16:08.960
What thing?

00:16:12.679 --> 00:16:13.399
What thing?

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:14.440
Rou'er!

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.799
Where's my Rou'er? My Rou'er!

00:16:18.799 --> 00:16:20.600
Rou'er is missing!

00:16:21.039 --> 00:16:22.240
My lord!

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.360
This commoner's Rou'er hasn't been found yet!

00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:27.600
The Fifth Princess's illness...

00:16:27.759 --> 00:16:30.000
This commoner is powerless to treat.

00:16:30.639 --> 00:16:32.840
Please find someone more capable, my lord.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.519
Let's go quickly.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.159
Rou'er is lost!

00:16:45.039 --> 00:16:46.080
Princess, rest assured,

00:16:46.559 --> 00:16:47.799
this servant will definitely find a way

00:16:48.279 --> 00:16:49.600
to restore your mind.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.680
Evil spirits and malevolent entities,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.119
disperse at once!

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.599
Return the Princess's mind!

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:38.559
Demons, ghosts, and monsters,

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.000
show yourselves immediately!

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.400
Otherwise, I'll stab you to death!

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:43.839
Stab you to death!

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:45.519
Stab you to death!

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:53.960
Princess,

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.839
the peach wood sword is useless.

00:18:00.319 --> 00:18:01.400
Princess, don't worry.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.599
This servant had Xiao Lizi inquire about many folk remedies.

00:18:03.759 --> 00:18:04.880
We will definitely cure you.

00:18:11.839 --> 00:18:14.079
Bathing in dog's blood every day

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.839
Darn it, Xiao Lizi

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.000
How could this method be used on the princess?

00:18:20.799 --> 00:18:22.480
This girl is still somewhat sensible.

00:18:23.079 --> 00:18:24.960
What a waste of dog's blood.

00:18:27.079 --> 00:18:28.400
Fierce flames to exorcise evil.

00:18:28.839 --> 00:18:29.240
No.

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.519
Baptism by a virgin boy's urine.

00:18:31.599 --> 00:18:32.160
This won't do either.

00:18:33.039 --> 00:18:33.480
No.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.720
This one might work.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.079
As long as the princess can regain her senses,

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.920
shaving her head to become a nun is no big deal.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.440
From now on, let your servant

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:04.720
No!

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:05.920
No!

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:08.319
Princess, if you cannot regain your senses,

00:19:08.599 --> 00:19:11.960
I... I would have failed Consort Chen.

00:19:14.079 --> 00:19:14.519
Princess?

00:19:14.839 --> 00:19:15.880
Princess, what's wrong?

00:19:16.599 --> 00:19:17.799
I'll go find a royal physician right away.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:18.519
Wait here.

00:19:24.119 --> 00:19:24.920
I'm fine.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.920
Princess?

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.759
Wonderful!

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.319
The peach wood sword!

00:19:34.599 --> 00:19:36.559
The peach wood sword really worked!

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.519
I... I'll go tell His Majesty at once.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:41.160
Wait.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.440
Don't tell anyone else about this for now.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.079
Why?

00:19:49.799 --> 00:19:50.720
The more she knows,

00:19:51.039 --> 00:19:52.400
the less beneficial it may be for Xixi.

00:19:55.519 --> 00:19:58.039
Last night, I dreamed of Chen...

00:19:58.759 --> 00:19:59.920
I dreamed of my mother.

00:20:00.319 --> 00:20:03.799
She said I've committed too many wrongs,

00:20:04.319 --> 00:20:05.200
and I need...

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.240
I need to pretend to be foolish and dim-witted,

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.400
endure hardships,

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.480
to atone for my sins.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:14.319
You're right.

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:16.480
Therefore,

00:20:16.599 --> 00:20:18.440
this matter must not be known by others.

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:19.839
Otherwise, all our efforts will be wasted.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:21.839
I must

00:20:21.839 --> 00:20:23.559
continue pretending to be an idiot for a while longer.

00:20:24.519 --> 00:20:25.240
Besides,

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.319
I've only regained my senses now.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.839
I don't remember many things from the past.

00:20:31.039 --> 00:20:32.599
It's better to wait until my memory fully returns

00:20:32.759 --> 00:20:33.680
before telling Father.

00:20:35.039 --> 00:20:36.000
I understand.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.599
I would die before telling a soul.

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.680
Not even Lord Yuwen?

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.079
Absolutely not.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:48.920
By the way, Xixi,

00:20:49.319 --> 00:20:50.839
tell me about the Fourth Princess.

00:20:51.319 --> 00:20:52.440
My mother appeared in my dream,

00:20:52.519 --> 00:20:53.599
telling me to get closer to her.

00:20:55.319 --> 00:20:58.839
The Fourth Princess probably isn't willing to get close to you right now.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:00.319
Why?

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.160
I inquired about it.

00:21:02.519 --> 00:21:04.200
The play you wrote about the Fourth Princess

00:21:04.319 --> 00:21:05.599
was seen by Consort Shu.

00:21:05.839 --> 00:21:07.599
Her Highness was so enraged

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:08.920
that she suffered a heart attack.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.599
Consort Shu...

00:21:12.519 --> 00:21:13.599
The Fourth Princess's mother.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.000
She still hasn't woken up.

00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:28.200
How is Her Highness?

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.240
What did the royal physicians say?

00:21:32.119 --> 00:21:32.839
The physicians said...

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:34.359
Mother's illness...

00:21:34.519 --> 00:21:35.160
Princess?

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:35.920
I'm afraid...

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.480
Princess?

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.000
What is it?

00:21:38.599 --> 00:21:40.000
The miracle doctor Lord Yuwen invited

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.720
claims he can cure Her Highness's heart condition.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:42.599
Really?

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:45.039
Seventh Cousin,

00:21:45.319 --> 00:21:46.319
regarding Her Majesty the Empress,

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.799
I'll go pay my respects later.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:48.599
Please convey my apologies.

00:21:48.799 --> 00:21:49.200
Alright.

00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:51.000
Let's go.

00:21:54.599 --> 00:21:55.960
None of those methods worked.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.319
I heard yesterday

00:21:59.319 --> 00:22:00.920
the princess rushed off

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.359
to find that scorpion-raising miracle doctor.

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.680
I thought the princess had regained her senses.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:05.960
The princess sought that doctor

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.880
because she was worried about Consort Shu.

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.759
Worried about Consort Shu?

00:22:10.599 --> 00:22:12.519
It seems the Fifth Princess is truly very ill.

00:22:12.519 --> 00:22:13.440
What are you talking about?

00:22:14.039 --> 00:22:15.720
The miracle doctor is very eccentric.

00:22:16.359 --> 00:22:20.000
He said Consort Shu is merely unconscious,

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.799
but he has lost his Rou'er.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.359
To beg the doctor to treat Her Highness,

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.720
the princess searched for that Rou'er all night.

00:22:29.359 --> 00:22:30.720
She finally found it,

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:33.400
but her hand got stung, swollen like a radish.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.759
I happen to have

00:22:35.759 --> 00:22:36.920
a folk remedy to reduce swelling and pain.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.440
Five qian of silver.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:39.680
Want to try it?

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:40.960
Does it work well?

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.279
It's very effective.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:43.319
Fine, fine, fine.

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.960
About the princess begging the doctor to treat Consort Shu,

00:22:47.359 --> 00:22:48.599
you must absolutely not tell anyone.

00:22:49.319 --> 00:22:49.920
Don't worry.

00:22:50.799 --> 00:22:51.400
Hand over the silver.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.599
So the Fifth Princess actually...

00:22:56.559 --> 00:22:57.279
Give me the silver.

00:23:06.559 --> 00:23:07.799
Fourth Sister.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:10.839
What happened to your hand?

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:26.640
What's going on?

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:28.200
Sister...

00:23:28.559 --> 00:23:30.039
I didn't do it on purpose.

00:23:30.559 --> 00:23:31.799
Please be magnanimous

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.759
and forgive me this once.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.400
How would I know

00:23:39.319 --> 00:23:40.480
if you did it on purpose or not?

00:23:40.759 --> 00:23:42.880
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:48.039
Then, sister, how can I appease your anger?

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:49.400
Ouch!

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:50.359
Ouch!

00:23:52.359 --> 00:23:53.000
Very well.

00:23:53.759 --> 00:23:56.519
Just now, while I was feeding the fish in this lotus pond,

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:02.279
unfortunately, my bracelet seems to have fallen into the water.

00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:10.440
I wonder if my sister would be willing

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.839
to go into the water and help me look for it?

00:24:31.839 --> 00:24:32.680
What is this?

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.519
My bracelet

00:24:38.759 --> 00:24:40.799
accidentally fell into this pond.

00:24:41.119 --> 00:24:43.599
Noble Lady Liu insisted on helping.

00:24:44.359 --> 00:24:45.359
Isn't that right, Noble Lady Liu?

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:52.559
Yes.

00:24:55.279 --> 00:24:56.359
It's just a bracelet.

00:24:57.079 --> 00:24:58.160
No need to go into the water for it.

00:25:00.319 --> 00:25:01.200
This bracelet...

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:02.720
was given to me when I first entered the palace.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.640
His Majesty bestowed it.

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.839
It holds great significance for me.

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:07.519
If not for...

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.960
If not for Noble Lady Liu insisting on helping...

00:25:11.039 --> 00:25:13.119
and holding me back from entering the water...

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.000
I surely would have...

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.000
found it by now.

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.079
A Lan can help.

00:25:27.519 --> 00:25:28.599
While they're not looking...

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:29.799
A Lan will help you fall into the water.

00:25:29.799 --> 00:25:30.640
To find the bracelet.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:36.920
Your Highness!

00:25:37.519 --> 00:25:38.000
Your Highness!

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.559
Help!

00:25:40.359 --> 00:25:40.920
Help!

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.240
Consort Yu is looking for her bracelet!

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:43.799
You all, wait over there.

00:25:43.799 --> 00:25:44.200
Help!

00:25:44.839 --> 00:25:45.400
Yes, yes.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.160
H-help!

00:25:48.119 --> 00:25:48.880
Go see.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:52.160
Quick, find the bracelet!

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.839
Fifth Princess, you...

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:55.640
You...

00:25:57.359 --> 00:25:59.359
Look, the bracelet is over there!

00:26:01.319 --> 00:26:02.240
What are you looking at?

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.400
Hurry and get me out of the water!

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:05.799
Yes, yes. You...

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.200
What... what is going on here?

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.000
Your Majesty!

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:12.680
Rescue them quickly!

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:16.400
Your Majesty!

00:26:16.799 --> 00:26:18.359
Noble Lady Liu had good intentions.

00:26:18.359 --> 00:26:20.240
She entered the water to help me find the bracelet.

00:26:20.279 --> 00:26:21.200
The Fifth Princess, she...

00:26:24.319 --> 00:26:28.160
She also ultimately had good intentions.

00:26:29.039 --> 00:26:29.720
You, tell me...

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.599
why did you kick Consort Yu into the water?

00:26:32.119 --> 00:26:34.559
A Lan just wanted to help.

00:26:37.759 --> 00:26:38.400
Your Majesty.

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.720
The Fifth Princess, she...

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.440
didn't do it on purpose.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.400
Your Majesty, please don't scold her further.

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:51.720
Fourth Sister.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.400
A Lan doesn't understand.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:54.720
Don't understand what?

00:26:55.079 --> 00:26:57.319
Her Highness wanted to go into the water to find the bracelet.

00:26:57.799 --> 00:26:59.640
A Lan helped Her Highness into the water.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.759
Her Highness went into the water.

00:27:01.759 --> 00:27:03.160
A Lan saw the bracelet.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.039
But then Her Highness stopped looking.

00:27:05.799 --> 00:27:07.359
Why is that?

00:27:09.799 --> 00:27:10.359
That's right.

00:27:11.319 --> 00:27:12.440
Didn't you just say...

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.559
you insisted on going down to find the bracelet?

00:27:15.079 --> 00:27:16.400
Was it Noble Lady Liu holding you back?

00:27:16.759 --> 00:27:17.559
Then why, once you fell in...

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:18.480
did you stop looking?

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.079
Your servant...

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:23.799
Your servant...

00:27:23.799 --> 00:27:25.880
That bracelet really fell into the water.

00:27:27.799 --> 00:27:30.119
Your servant wasn't sure.

00:27:30.279 --> 00:27:30.880
It's just that...

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:31.680
Just what?

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:33.440
J-just...

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:36.440
Guards!

00:27:37.119 --> 00:27:38.119
Escort Consort Yu back to her palace.

00:27:38.559 --> 00:27:39.119
Effective immediately...

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.200
she is confined to her quarters for half a month.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:40.880
Yes.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:41.359
No!

00:27:41.359 --> 00:27:42.400
Your Majesty, please don't!

00:27:42.759 --> 00:27:43.359
Your Majesty!

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:44.759
Your servant knows she was wrong.

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.559
Your Majesty, your servant knows she was wrong!

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:48.920
Your Majesty!

00:27:50.599 --> 00:27:51.240
Your Majesty!

00:27:52.319 --> 00:27:53.799
Then your servant will also take her leave now.

00:28:05.039 --> 00:28:07.759
I heard the miracle doctor treating A Lan...

00:28:07.759 --> 00:28:09.640
has a way to cure your mother's heart condition.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.440
Your son also just heard about it.

00:28:11.839 --> 00:28:12.799
I was just about to go see.

00:28:13.839 --> 00:28:15.759
Then I shall accompany you.

00:28:16.039 --> 00:28:16.480
Yes.

00:28:20.519 --> 00:28:21.960
A Lan, what happened to your hand?

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.640
Beloved Minister Yuwen.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.480
You escort A Lan back to the palace.

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.839
Your humble servant obeys the decree.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:47.039
Fifth Princess.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:48.359
Let's go.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.319
Yuwen Rui saw me kick Consort Yu into the water.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.119
Will he become suspicious?

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.119
What is the Fifth Princess thinking about?

00:29:15.119 --> 00:29:15.839
So engrossed.

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:17.920
Thinking about Eldest Cousin.

00:29:18.119 --> 00:29:19.519
Eldest Cousin is handsome.

00:29:23.519 --> 00:29:24.200
Fifth Princess.

00:29:26.079 --> 00:29:26.799
Your jade pendant.

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:31.759
It was indeed him.

00:29:49.519 --> 00:29:50.880
If I tell the emperor...

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.039
that Yuwen Rui administered the poison...

00:29:52.759 --> 00:29:54.839
could he finally get killed off?

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.359
With just you?

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:58.839
How could you possibly handle Yuwen Rui?

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.319
The original Fifth Princess...

00:30:00.319 --> 00:30:02.279
after being poisoned, with her last breath...

00:30:02.599 --> 00:30:04.079
accused Yuwen Rui of poisoning her.

00:30:04.559 --> 00:30:05.240
But in the end?

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.599
Yuwen Rui was still completely unscathed.

00:30:11.759 --> 00:30:13.680
The wicked live for a thousand years.

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:20.759
Fourth Sister.

00:30:22.759 --> 00:30:23.839
Apply it once in the morning and once at night.

00:30:24.359 --> 00:30:25.119
It can relieve the pain.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.400
F-Fourth Princess.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:31.880
I have other matters.

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:32.839
I'll take my leave first.

00:30:37.319 --> 00:30:38.319
If you have any matters in the future...

00:30:38.559 --> 00:30:39.519
you can come find me directly.

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:40.920
Yes.

00:30:42.359 --> 00:30:43.480
If she wishes to go to Yaohua Palace...

00:30:44.079 --> 00:30:45.279
you are to take her there at any time.

00:30:47.119 --> 00:30:48.000
Yes, Fourth Princess.

00:31:02.119 --> 00:31:02.720
Princess.

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.480
The Fourth Princess's attitude towards you...

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.000
is different from before.

00:31:06.839 --> 00:31:08.559
You really seem like a different person.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.880
Not only do you realize Minister Yuwen's goodness...

00:31:11.039 --> 00:31:12.359
you've even fallen for Minister Yuwen.

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.079
How could I possibly like Yuwen Rui?

00:31:20.519 --> 00:31:21.039
Princess,

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:22.240
liking Lord Yuwen

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.519
is something you said yourself.

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.640
Back then, saying I liked him

00:31:27.039 --> 00:31:27.640
was only because

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.160
of that lousy booklet you found.

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:31.720
Your servant looked for the picture book

00:31:32.119 --> 00:31:33.039
also because

00:31:33.039 --> 00:31:35.480
you said you wanted to understand Lord Yuwen.

00:31:36.079 --> 00:31:37.759
Princess, don't be shy.

00:31:39.359 --> 00:31:40.000
But Princess,

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
how did you suddenly fall for Lord Yuwen?

00:31:42.759 --> 00:31:43.519
I know!

00:31:44.039 --> 00:31:46.359
It must be because Lord Yuwen is deeply loyal.

00:31:46.519 --> 00:31:47.480
Seeing the princess in her simple state,

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:48.720
he still, without a word,

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.319
gave you such a precious item as the hairpin.

00:31:50.319 --> 00:31:51.319
He gave it to you.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:53.279
The princess couldn't help but be deeply moved.

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.359
Lord Yuwen,

00:31:54.359 --> 00:31:55.240
are the grapes tasty?

00:31:56.319 --> 00:31:57.400
Extremely sweet.

00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:57.799
And,

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:03.720
how did you know I stole some grapes?

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.079
Be smarter next time.

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:17.000
Don't get grape skins on your skirt again.

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.359
The Fifth Princess took poison

00:32:22.759 --> 00:32:24.519
and actually managed to survive.

00:32:25.759 --> 00:32:26.559
Do we need

00:32:27.759 --> 00:32:29.240
to find another way to kill her?

00:32:30.319 --> 00:32:31.119
No need to take the risk.

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.000
Let's wait a bit longer.

00:32:33.839 --> 00:32:36.519
There's still no lead from the Shadow Gate.

00:32:41.359 --> 00:32:42.680
Who would have thought that back then,

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.039
the once-dominant World's Number One Sect

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:49.440
would now vanish into thin air.

00:32:50.279 --> 00:32:51.319
The Shadow Gate knows

00:32:51.559 --> 00:32:54.119
how to decipher the secrets on the Map of the Nine Provinces.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.880
Its disciples naturally won't appear casually.

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:01.279
The urgent task now

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.480
is to find the map first.

00:33:05.519 --> 00:33:06.799
Have you found a new miracle doctor?

00:33:07.359 --> 00:33:07.960
Your Majesty,

00:33:08.519 --> 00:33:09.079
not yet.

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:15.279
Your Majesty,

00:33:16.319 --> 00:33:18.160
aren't you preparing to choose an auspicious day

00:33:18.599 --> 00:33:19.559
to pray for the people

00:33:19.559 --> 00:33:21.279
of the three southeastern provinces hit by floods?

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:23.160
Why not take this opportunity

00:33:23.279 --> 00:33:24.119
to also pray together

00:33:24.279 --> 00:33:26.640
for the Fifth Princess's swift recovery of her mind?

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:38.920
In the beginning of primordial chaos,

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:40.680
the five elements were not yet in motion,

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.240
the two luminaries not yet bright.

00:33:42.319 --> 00:33:44.480
Within it stood tall,

00:33:44.759 --> 00:33:46.519
existence and void held no sound.

00:33:46.519 --> 00:33:48.359
The Divine Sovereign emerged to rule,

00:33:48.359 --> 00:33:50.160
first distinguishing the turbid from the clear.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.720
He established heaven and earth,

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:57.519
and all things came to life.

00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:13.639
Look!

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.000
Your Majesty!

00:34:24.199 --> 00:34:25.760
This is an auspicious sign!

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:33.320
Feudal superstition is no good.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.800
This... this is...

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.519
What is happening?

00:35:05.639 --> 00:35:06.119
Guards!

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:07.920
Light the lanterns!

00:35:08.159 --> 00:35:08.519
Yes!

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.519
How could this be?

00:35:18.159 --> 00:35:19.119
What on earth is going on?

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:23.000
Your Majesty,

00:35:23.519 --> 00:35:24.199
lanterns falling on their own,

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:25.159
wind snapping flags...

00:35:25.639 --> 00:35:28.480
This... this is an inauspicious omen!

00:35:34.199 --> 00:35:34.960
Around the altar,

00:35:35.239 --> 00:35:37.400
only the flag in the southeast direction was snapped by the wind.

00:35:38.639 --> 00:35:39.639
Thus it can be seen

00:35:39.679 --> 00:35:40.599
that within our Yunmi borders,

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.199
the southeast must be filled with suffering,

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.239
with deep resentment!

00:35:46.239 --> 00:35:47.000
Nonsense!

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:49.760
The flood in the three southeastern provinces has passed.

00:35:50.679 --> 00:35:52.480
The people have gradually returned to their former peace.

00:35:53.639 --> 00:35:55.639
Prince Ning merits praise for the disaster relief.

00:35:56.519 --> 00:35:58.119
How could there be widespread suffering

00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.199
and deep resentment?

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:01.400
This...

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:03.519
Exactly!

00:36:04.159 --> 00:36:06.239
High Priest, you must be mistaken.

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:09.519
Your Majesty,

00:36:09.519 --> 00:36:11.000
this matter concerns the nation's fate.

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:13.480
I... I dare not speak recklessly.

00:36:15.239 --> 00:36:15.719
Your Majesty,

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.280
this is a matter of great importance.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.559
Why not send someone to investigate thoroughly?

00:36:24.639 --> 00:36:25.400
Beloved Minister Yuwen,

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:26.880
Your Majesty.

00:36:27.199 --> 00:36:29.960
Then I entrust this matter to you.

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:30.519
Your Majesty,

00:36:31.679 --> 00:36:34.639
since this matter concerns the people's safety and suffering,

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.159
the person responsible for investigating it

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.199
must be of upright character,

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.320
incorruptible and impartial,

00:36:40.519 --> 00:36:42.000
putting the common people first.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:47.039
I'm afraid the Grand Chancellor is not suitable.

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.960
I urge Your Majesty to reconsider.

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:51.639
Then, Grand Preceptor Meng, tell us

00:36:52.159 --> 00:36:53.920
who is more suitable than this official?

00:36:55.039 --> 00:36:56.039
Among all the officials,

00:36:56.679 --> 00:36:57.800
those more suitable than you

00:36:58.320 --> 00:36:59.880
I'm afraid I couldn't finish listing them anytime soon.

00:37:03.119 --> 00:37:07.159
Then, does the Grand Preceptor have a suitable candidate in mind?

00:37:15.679 --> 00:37:16.199
Your Majesty,

00:37:17.039 --> 00:37:19.159
this humble official is willing to share Your Majesty's burden.

00:37:20.519 --> 00:37:21.760
Then I'll trouble the Grand Preceptor.

00:37:22.159 --> 00:37:24.320
Be sure to investigate thoroughly.

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.239
I will not fail in my mission.

00:37:45.079 --> 00:37:45.679
Master.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:56.400
What is it?

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:01.239
The flags are so pretty.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:04.360
Let's go.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:05.559
I'll take you back to the palace.

00:38:07.039 --> 00:38:07.480
Let's go.

00:38:11.039 --> 00:38:13.239
This Cannon Fodder Constitution that keeps stumbling upon secrets

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:14.360
is really going to be the death of me.
