00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.460
Guang, look.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.400
A giant radish.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.100
Whoa, it's huge.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.039
Isn't it gorgeous?

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.140
Back in the day,

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.080
I wouldn't take a cent from your mother.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.920
But now, your grandpa and I

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.800
are hounding your dad for every last bit

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.960
and we're stashing it all away for you.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.900
It's all going to be yours.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.060
Otherwise,

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.740
it'll just end up
in someone else's pockets.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.860
Grandma,

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.900
you and Grandpa should buy
whatever you need.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.580
I've got plenty of money, okay?

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.060
We've got food
and a roof over our heads.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.100
Our medical's covered too.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.480
What on earth would we even spend it on?

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.700
Don't touch that.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.900
Leave it be.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.520
Just leave it.

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:21.660
I was just trying to shake the snow off.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.120
It's still got so many leaves.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.680
Is it gonna make it?

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:24.480
It's fine.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.740
The leaves are brittle
and the snow is heavy.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.820
They'll snap right off
once you touch them.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.820
Just

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.560
let it melt.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.480
I'm just worried it'll freeze.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.040
Look how tiny it is.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.420
It'll be all grown up
by Chinese New Year.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.700

Grandma,

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.600
my mom says we're going skiing
over the break.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.660
So I won't be able to spend it with you.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.440
But I'll come see you as much as I can
before and after!

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.880
Just go

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.140
see the world.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.860
You don't have to visit so often.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.740
Country life is pretty boring anyway.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.420
Besides, we're doing just fine.

You're a grown-up now.

Why is everyone today saying that?

Did your mom mention it too?

Well, it's about time.

I bet the boys are lining up for you.

food cooked over a wood fire

I insisted on having this stove,

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.580
but your dad fought me
every step of the way.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.420
Said it wasn't modern enough
and that it looked out of place.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.680
He thought people would laugh at us.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:22.760
He was

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.260
so full of himself.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:25.840

to just build one.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.620

Even if you did,
Dad wouldn't stand a chance against you.

No wonder he stopped coming around.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.460
Like I care.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.320
He can please himself.

What's wrong that?

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:04.760
Well,

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.300
she's too diplomatic
and always plays it by the book.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.100
You can't reason with a man.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.720
Give them an inch
and they'll take a mile.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:11.440
You have to break them in

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.080
until they know who's boss.

She's right.

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:37.679
Just do what she says.

you've done so much for us.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:46.360
You deserve the best bites.

Grandpa,

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.200
since you've been staying in line,

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.340
you get some more too.

These are all fresh from the patch.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:00.480
Take them to your mom.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.900
If it's too much,
just give some to your friends.

Okay.

Keeping a sharp eye out
for the right one.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.080
Take your time.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.540
If you're not sure about someone,

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.340
bring him home
and let me give him the once-over.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:17.060
Got it.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.620
I'm heading out now.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.220
Bye, Grandpa.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:21.880
Alright.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:22.920
Drive safe.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:23.280
I will.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:24.640
I'll come see you guys again soon.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:25.160
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.100
Take care.

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:26.600
Alright.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:09.060
Tomorrow at work, I'll see him again.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:15.140
Xiguang.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:15.960
Xiguang.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:17.180
Xiguang.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.160
Xiguang.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.920
You look so out of it today.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.180
Did you stay up late last night?

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:27.340
Not really.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.200
Maybe it's just the cold.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.300
Yeah.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.880
It snowed again last night.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.000
Good thing we've got heating
in the office.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:40.600
Everyone, hurry.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:41.460
Come on.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.080
Grab your weapons.

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.040
Coming through.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.400
Another heavy snow last night.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:51.920
If we don't clear the way,

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:52.800
everything's going to be
at a standstill.

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:53.760
Plus, it's a safety hazard.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.560
As per usual,

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.480
each department is responsible
for their own zone.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:58.960
Mr. Lin will be joining us shortly.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:00.340
I appreciate your help, everyone.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:01.160
- Okay.
- Got it.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:01.920
Grab your tools.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:02.340
- Okay.
- Got it.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:02.900
And let's go.

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.440
- Okay.
- Got it.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:06.080
We've been assigned

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.460
a precision job,

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.580
clearing the snow

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:09.560
off the rooftop PV panels.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:13.480
Mr. Zhang.

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.100
Mr. Lin.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.140
You are up here already?

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.380
I got here early

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:20.760
and dragged Mr. Lin along with me.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.000
Let's get to work.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.740
But Mr. Zhang, you...

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:26.280
Wang,

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:27.380
what's that supposed to mean?

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:29.140
You think I'm too old for this?

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.260
I've been doing this

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:32.500
every year.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:33.500
Your Mr. Lin doesn't have

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:34.860
half the experience I do.

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:36.300
That's for sure.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.260
Mr. Zhang shared

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:38.340
some of his best tips.

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:39.960
Careful on your feet, Mr. Zhang.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:40.760
Got it.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.240
Alright everyone, let's get to it.

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:43.780
Go ahead and stake out your zones.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:44.800
- Got it.
- Okay.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.040
Careful.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:09.740
Xiguang,

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:10.860
let's start over here.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.500
The snow up here seems

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:22.560
a bit thinner than it is on the ground.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:23.860
Is it because PV panels

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:24.820
get hot enough

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:25.700
to melt the snow?

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.540
Actually, it's because the tech team

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:30.800
cleared them over the New Year break.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.500
You have to stay on top

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:33.300
of the snow removal.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.460
Otherwise, if it ices over,

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:35.560
it could actually

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:36.300
damage the panels.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:38.900
Got it.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.280
Take it easy, guys.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Watch the surface

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:44.500
and don't scuff it up.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:45.180
Alright.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.320
Are these panels scratched?

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.420
I hope I don't have to pay for this.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:05.900
First, make sure

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:07.040
you're both okay.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:08.280
I'm fine.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.600
Thanks for checking on us, Mr. Lin.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.440
I'm fine too.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:21.560
Let's divvy up the work.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:22.760
You guys sweep the areas nearby.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.520
Leave the hard-to-reach spots for me.

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:25.760
Got it.

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:45.220
Xiguang,

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.860
you're way too efficient.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.060
What's the rush?
Are you pushed by ghosts?

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.060
Come on, you guys

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:57.260
bundle up a bit more.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:58.880
Don't just choose fashion

00:13:58.920 --> 00:13:59.760
over function.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:09.940
I'll take it from here.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:10.820
Thanks.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.280
No sign

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:19.040
of the other teams yet.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.340
We're leading the pack.

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:23.460
Grab some hot water, everyone,

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.100
and warm up a bit.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:25.740
Mr. Lin wants us to huddle up in a bit.

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:32.580
I've reviewed the plan
for the year-end party.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:33.940
Let's tweak the agenda a bit.

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.100
Cut back on the formal speeches,

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.340
and focus more
on the fun and relaxing parts.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:39.880
Copy that.

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:41.000
We'll

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.020
fine-tune it later.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:43.940
It's a tough year for everyone.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.520
Our competitors are dropping like flies.

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.500
Do we need

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.480
to slash the prize budget?

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:53.940
Let's stick with what we had last year.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:55.480
Also,

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:56.960
besides the tangible gifts,

00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:58.680
let's throw in

00:14:58.780 --> 00:14:59.660
some creative incentives,

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:00.960
like,

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:02.620
a week of paid leave, for instance.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:03.540
I'm down for that.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.260
Great.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:05.280
That'll do.

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:06.500
Awesome.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:08.000
Everyone's gonna love it.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.200
We need to start sourcing
the tangible prizes.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.560
Yin Jie and Nie,
you'll be in charge of that.

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:13.520
Just follow last year's lead.

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:14.600
We also need to lock in

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:15.580
the venue for the party ASAP.

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.400
Besides our usual partner hotels,

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:18.780
let's explore other options too.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.160
See if you can find a better deal.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:21.960
And make sure to take plenty of photos.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:22.560
Okay.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:23.740
And

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:24.740
one more thing.

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.120
We can swap out

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.400
the catering contractor.

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.220
That food was garbage.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:34.620
Finally, we're done with them.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:35.560
The last time I ate there,
I got an upset stomach.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:35.940
Exactly.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:36.880
It's long overdue.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:37.360
Okay.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:37.920
Good riddance.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:38.400
Tell me about it.

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:44.180
Alright,

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.700
that's all for today.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:46.640
Back to work, everyone.

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:51.980
Let's go.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:54.500
Mr. Lin,

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.100
there's something
I need to go over with you.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:57.040
Look,

00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:58.320
do we still need

00:15:58.860 --> 00:15:59.940
to tweak this?

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:01.680
The budget looks perfect.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:02.320
No need to change anything.

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:04.040
I'll drop it off
for your sign-off shortly.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:05.140
Okay.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.520
We're just doing the legwork.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.160
Everything has to
go through the higher-ups.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:13.600
But to be honest,

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.520
your pricing

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:16.960
just isn't competitive.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.260
Our venue is fairly new,

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.260
and we're very easy to work with.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:20.620
But,

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:21.780
you don't have much of a reputation yet.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.720
This is our year-end party.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.060
We need to make it fancy.

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.560
I totally fell for it.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.700
I thought

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:30.860
this was a cushy gig,

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.040
just an excuse to stroll around.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:33.840
But I didn't see this coming.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.080
My legs are absolutely killing me,

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.320
and I've talked myself hoarse.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.440
But you were so convincing back there.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:39.660
Tell me about it.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.240
I'm a natural-born negotiator.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.340
I'm beat.

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:47.700
I'm gonna grab some drinks to recharge.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:54.120
Thanks.

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:57.800
Thanks.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.220
This is pretty good.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:11.500
Xiguang.

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:16.980
What's wrong?

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.099
You've been acting a bit off
since you got back

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:20.119
from the New Year break.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.540
Don't tell me you and Mr. Lin

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:23.579
had a falling out

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:24.980
at that wedding in Shanghai?

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:28.800
Not really.

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:30.380
So why give me all those files

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:32.060
over the last few days

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.020
and dump the sign-off on me?

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:34.740
Oh, and another thing.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:35.960
What was with you

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.060
in the elevator the other day?

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.580
When Mr. Lin walked in,

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.200
you acted

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.180
like you were fascinated by your shoes.

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:46.800
Now that I think about it,

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:49.480
the snow shoveling was shady too.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.680
You were blasting through it so fast

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:56.080
just to avoid facing Mr. Lin?

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:01.560
What are you doing?

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:04.420
That's a very suspicious look
you've got there.

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.360
How about I buy you dinner tonight?

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.020
We'll have squirrel-shaped mandarin fish
and Gordon Euryale seed.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:21.680
Nice try, but don't dodge the question.

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:23.920
From your reactions,

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:25.380
you're not in trouble with him.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.920
Are you...?

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:41.840
Nie,

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:43.660
you should treat me to dinner tonight.

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:45.340
I've got some major tea to spill.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.200
That prick, Lin Yusen,

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:48.300
actually hung up on me.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:49.920
I'm telling on him.

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:51.940
Unbelievable.

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.020
I've helped him out so much.

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:55.400
Now that I need a hand,

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.140
he actually has the nerve
to hang up on me?

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:04.420
Well,

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:05.880
tit for tat then.

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:07.220
Nie,

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:08.440
you have to see him
for who he really is,

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.780
a wolf in sheep's clothing.

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:10.760
And how he stayed at the hospital

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:11.880
just to linger and talk surgery with us.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:12.620
You know where I'm getting at, right?

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.140
He did

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:14.800
give us

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.160
a lot of helpful advice.

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:17.240
And

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:18.420
the whole eating together thing,

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:19.340
that was all his doing.

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:20.240
I'm sure you're aware.

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:21.580
Coaxing you into Lu Sha's wedding?

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:22.460
I'll spare you the lecture

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:23.760
on how bad that is.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:27.520
Yeah.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.500
But Shengyi,

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:35.340
are you really here to spill the tea?

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.560
Nie, spending time with Yusen

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.080
is finally rubbing off on you.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:47.480
Not bad.

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:49.840
I'm just

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:51.540
doing this for fun.

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:53.720
He's dragging our reputation

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.520
through the mud.

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:56.880
You get me, right?

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:00.440
So

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:03.580
he told you everything?

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:06.940
He's very reserved...

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:08.420
If he hadn't

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.780
needed my help,

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.020
he would've

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:11.980
kept me in the dark forever.

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:14.260
Look at him.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:15.720
It speaks for itself.

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:18.940
I tried calling him,

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.240
but as soon as your name came up,

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.420
he just said he was busy

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:22.420
and shut me down.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.420
It's obvious

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:26.240
his pride is too wounded to face us.

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.040
He actually values his "pride" so much?

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:29.940
Nie.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.460
If someone like Yusen
doesn't make the cut,

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:35.540
who on earth are you looking for?

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.320
You don't get perks

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.340
without paying your dues.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.520
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:49.980
What are you on about?

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:51.800
Nie,

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:52.840
I'm totally lost here.

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:55.020
This whole deep vibe.

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:56.960
You're becoming just like him.

00:20:58.280 --> 00:20:58.840
Shengyi,

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:00.400
have some fish.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.120
Fish as a muzzle?

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:05.560
Fine. I am starving anyway.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.720
Two bowls did the trick. I'm stuffed.

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:22.600
Well...

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.480
I've got the night shift tonight,

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:26.620
so I won't be able
to give you a ride later.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.540
I just texted Yusen.

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:29.500
When he gets here,

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:30.700
he'll give you a lift home.

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:34.340
Shengyi.

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:37.720
A bit on the nose, isn't it?

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:40.800
Really?

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.080
Sorry.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:45.120
Surgery

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.040
is all about precision,

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:48.180
but outside the hospital,

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:49.620
we tend to just call a spade a spade.

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:50.800
You'll have to get used to it.

00:21:59.060 --> 00:21:59.760
See?

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:01.100
In his prime,

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.680
he could stun the entire cafeteria

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.760
just by walking in with a lunchbox.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.280
He might be older today,

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.320
but he hasn't lost his swagger one bit,

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:07.940
don't you think?

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.300
Nie, just think about it.

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.620
If you actually land him,

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:14.500
every single girl

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:15.920
from our med school days,

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.020
would be dying of envy

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:18.200
from miles away.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:19.960
How epic would that be?

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:20.920
Aren't you pumped?

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:22.180
Doesn't that just feel amazing?

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:25.580
Shengyi,

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.120
knock it off.

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:37.340
I haven't had a chance to eat.

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:38.380
Would you be okay

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:39.940
with me finishing these off?

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.560
Since Nie is picking up the tab,

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:42.780
as long as she's okay with it,

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.040
then I'm cool with it.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.860
Duty calls. Off to save lives.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.340
I'll leave

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.240
the bill

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:50.120

This is on me.

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.700
I promised Shengyi.

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:25.460

Here.

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:27.940
Take mine.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:33.400
I was just messing with you before.

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:34.520
But since I've already

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:35.760
laid my cards on the table,

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:37.520
there's no way I'm letting you
pick up the tab.

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:53.640
Cars aren't allowed back here.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:54.520
We'll have to walk a bit.

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:01.340
I had no idea

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:02.920
he was coming to see you today.

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:05.200
Don't take anything he said

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:06.400
to heart.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.700
He said

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.880
Miss Lu

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:16.360
never invited me to the wedding.

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:22.600
So he went over my head

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.580
to tattle to you.

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:26.500
Is that true?

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:28.140
Yeah.

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.460
Since I hadn't made my move yet,

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.440
I had to rack my brains

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.340
just to create an opportunity.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:37.700
I thought you'd be

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.300
at least a little shy about it.

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:43.260
After being that direct, though,

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.520
it feels a bit too late

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:45.780
to act embarrassed now.

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:49.940
I used to be

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:51.780
every bit as direct

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:52.540
as he is.

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:55.260
If I had met Lin Yusen first,

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:56.440
how would things have turned out?

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:58.900
Would I have fallen for him
at first sight?

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.720
With both of us
being so straight to the point,

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.800
would we have just clicked right away?

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:05.720
That probably would have been nice, too.

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:10.660
I wish I'd met you first.

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:34.840
Oh, shoot.

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:36.500
Did I just

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:37.320
say that out loud?

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:39.500
That might have been a bit much.

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:41.720
I hope he isn't mad.

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.460
Why do I always lose my cool

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:45.660
when I'm around him?

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:53.120
So,

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:56.460
what kind of favor
did Shengyi ask you for?

00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:59.160
He's working on a paper

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:00.540
that overlaps

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:01.300
with my previous research.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:02.560
He just wanted me

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:03.740
to run an eye over it.

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:05.920
He knew your situation

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:07.620
yet he still made you do all this.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.260
I shouldn't have treated him to dinner.

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:17.300
Don't worry about it.

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:18.840
I'm over it now.

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:21.960
A year of being dramatic about my hands

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.340
is more than enough.

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:25.900
Why keep it up forever?

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:41.680
I've been doing

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.020
a lot of reflecting
over the past few days.

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:51.780
I acted on impulse

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:54.320
and caught you off guard.

00:27:58.560 --> 00:27:59.600
No.

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:02.860

I'm sorry.

I shouldn't have

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:16.880
sprung that on you

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:18.280
when you were unprepared.

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:22.900
If it caused you any distress,

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:24.900
I apologize.

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:26.860
That sounds

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.020
so familiar.

I'm sorry.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:30.900
I honestly didn't realize

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:32.040
you and Rong had something going on.

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:33.180
Otherwise,

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.860
I wouldn't have confessed to you.

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:36.120
I hope

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.460
I didn't cause you any trouble.

Don't say that.

Don't say things like that.

Okay, I'll stop.

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:56.500
But,

00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:58.700
what did I even say?

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.880
You're practically in tears now.

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:04.100
Such a crybaby.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:04.940
Don't apologize.

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:09.280
Don't apologize for this.

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:13.400
Fine, I won't.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:17.320
It's been painful

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:21.080
to watch you struggle
just to stay away from me.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:22.780

Please, stop avoiding me, okay?

It's exhausting for you,

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:31.840
and it's hard for me

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:33.560
to play along and let you hide.

I thought

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:40.600
I was just being smart,

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.140
with maxed-out evasion stats.

serious?

Yeah.

a shareholder's opinion on something.

I learned from the best, Mr. Lin.

But that patch of land over there

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.480
is still up in the air.

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:54.700
Follow me.

Right here.

That's a sudden question.

I'm drawing a blank right now.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:24.720
But honestly, I've always felt

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:27.160
the site is a bit sterile.

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:29.400
Sterile?

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:30.500
Yeah.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.100
We've got lawns and lots of green space

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:34.880
over by the offices and dorms,

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:36.920
but the plant itself

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:37.740
is looking a bit bare.

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:39.620
Maybe we could

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.400
green up this section a bit?

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:46.600
Why don't we do

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:47.940
a PV-powered eco-garden?

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:49.380
It'll be totally solar-powered,

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.660
with a nice lawn and some greenery,

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:53.060
and we can toss in
some outdoor furniture.

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:54.240
For the roof, we can use

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.480
those adjustable PV panels
which can tilt.

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.300
They'd provide some shade on sunny days,

00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:59.660
and on cloudy days,
they can tilt open to let the light in.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.240
And if it rains, they'll seal shut.

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:02.920
We could even add a little kiosk

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.540
for beverages and snacks.

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:05.700
It'd be a huge hit.

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:06.960
Look, the admin building

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:08.180
has a spot like this,

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.260
but the plant doesn't.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:10.580
We should really set something up
over here, too,

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:12.040

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:25.600
What's our main goal?

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:29.820
I just got this task

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.600
last night myself,

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.180
so my ideas are still pretty raw.

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.640
I'm looking to brainstorm
a bit with all of you.

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:37.420
The basic idea is

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:39.760
to create a small garden

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:40.540
where the staff

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:41.700
can hang out
during their lunch breaks.

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.440
It'll have a PV roof

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:45.960
that provides shade, keeps the rain out,
and generates its own power.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:47.980
The site is seriously lacking
in green space right now,

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.820
so we're looking to liven it up.

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:52.320
So, does it need a main structure?

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:53.780
Yeah, we'll need one.

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.240
It doesn't have to be huge, though.

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:56.900
Maybe a footprint

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:57.800
of about 200 square meters?

00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:58.900
We can make it two stories.

00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:00.280
That shouldn't be a problem.

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:01.880
Wan, get this down.

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:03.440
Get in touch with the design firm

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:04.220
and ask for a few mock-ups,

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:05.280
budget included.

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:06.260
Copy that.

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:09.160
Mr. Ding.

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:09.740
Mr. Hua.

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:10.360
Take a seat.

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:12.540
We've discussed over the phone.

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:13.580
I'm sure Mr. Lin

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:14.280
has briefed you on this?

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:15.900
Yeah.

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.220
I just have one question:

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:18.780
are we going with BIPV

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:19.840
or BAPV?

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:30.000
[Pros and Cons of BIPV vs. BAPV]

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:37.300
So,

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:38.080
it's BAPV.

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:40.000
Just a standalone

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:41.040
rooftop PV system,

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:42.360
right?

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:45.700
Then why am I even here?

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:47.740
This is way too simple.

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:48.720
Ke,

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:50.240
link up with them.

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:50.940
Got it.

00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.120
Looks like that new task from Mr. Lin

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.180
is quite the headache.

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:01.220
You've either been

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:02.760
running around like crazy
from office to office,

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:03.740
or you're glued to your chair,

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:04.480
buried in paperwork.

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:05.660
What's this?

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.540
You don't really get it either, do you?

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:12.120
Nope, not a clue.

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:14.120
Great.

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:16.080
At least I'm not
the only clueless one here.

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:17.320
Xiguang, look,

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.280
you can trash yourself all you want,

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:20.540
but leave me out of it.

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:22.520
Seriously, what is this thing?

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:24.580
I'm technically a part of this company,

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:26.620
and yet I've never even heard of it.

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.500
I'm still just scratching the surface,

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:31.200
but basically:

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:33.420
BAPV

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:34.940
is retrofitting buildings

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:36.320
with PV systems.

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:37.400
It's more of a standalone setup,

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:39.260
like what we have on our roof.

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:41.800
Then there's BIPV,

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:44.160
which is Building-Integrated Photovoltaics.

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:45.140
It's designed right into the building

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:45.820
from the start.

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:48.300
You use the PV panels
as actual building materials,

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:51.500
integrating them
into the roof, curtain walls,

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:52.440
or awnings.

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:54.500
It blends seamlessly with the structure,

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:57.040
making it more energy-efficient
and aesthetically pleasing.

00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:58.700
Of course,
it's much more complex to build.

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:01.640
I see.

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.580
Who would have known

00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:06.800
getting a small project off the ground

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.020
could be this complicated?

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.680
Procurement, Tech, Engineering,

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:11.440
Finance.

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:12.780
I have to deal
with every single department.

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:14.020
I'm mostly just winging it

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:14.800
and learning as I go.

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:18.260
Gee, I really walked straight
into a trap

00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:19.400
I set for myself.

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:21.860
Yin Jie,

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:23.920
how is it that

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:26.560
I'm playing both sides of the deal?

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:28.620
Well,

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:30.260
even though I'm totally lost,

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:32.100
that sounds

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:33.980
incredibly deep.

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:37.420
Yes.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:39.620
We all wear many hats.

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:41.140
Going from boss to subordinate

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:42.620
is a seamless flip.

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:45.200
Listen up, everyone.

00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:48.780
I've got some great news
about the cafeteria

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:49.520
to share with you all.

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:50.200
Come here.

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:51.140
What is it?

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:53.700
The cafeteria.

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:55.600
The plan to switch contractors

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:56.580
is moving at lightning speed.

00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:57.500
Word

00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:58.320
from Logistics is

00:38:58.700 --> 00:38:59.880
that after several rounds of vetting,

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:01.340
we're down

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:02.400
to the final three contenders.

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:04.760
Since their quotes are all pretty much
in the same ballpark,

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:06.040
Mr. Lin weighed in with a suggestion.

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:08.460
He said for a cafeteria,
we can't just look at the bottom line.

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:09.560
It's the taste that counts.

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:12.360
So the final call is to have two people

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:13.260
from each department

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:15.120
do a taste test and vote for the winner.

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:16.220
The food tasting

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:17.440
is happening tomorrow.

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:19.260
Awesome.

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:21.400
Who's the lucky one from our team?

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:23.560
Given that we're vetting this

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:24.500
for the entire staff,

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:26.360
naturally,
everyone's lining up for a spot.

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:27.520
Fair point.

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:28.680
But we've only got so many seats.

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:31.160
So, to be completely fair about it,

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:32.540
I've decided

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:33.500
we're going to draw straws.

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:34.760
Right.

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:35.840
That's as fair as it gets.

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:36.580
No one can argue with that.

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:37.520
- Yeah.
- Right.

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:38.740
Notice the slips

00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:39.320
in the bag?

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:41.060
Two are marked.

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:43.320
If you pick one, you're representing

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:43.880
our department.

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:45.660
Wait, what does the slip say?

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:47.320
You'll see if you're lucky enough
to grab one.

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:48.020
Who wants to start?

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:50.600
Please let it be me.

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:53.000
Mr. Lin.

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:54.500
What's going on here?

00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:56.720
Yeah, for the food tasting.

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:58.220
We're leaving it to chance
with a lucky draw.

00:39:58.940 --> 00:39:59.640
Would you like to join us?

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:00.560
No way,

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:01.980
that's going to mess with the odds.

00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:10.360
That's not what I meant.

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:12.560
So, what you're saying

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:14.280
is you'd love to have me join?

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:15.520
Of course.

00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:17.320
Swapping out the cafeteria
was your call.

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:18.560
You deserve all the credit,
so it's only right that you're here.

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:19.380
Nie's right.

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:20.740
Let's add one more slip of paper.

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:28.560
So, who's going first?

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:29.220
Me.

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:30.780
I want to be the master
of my own destiny.

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.060
Sure thing, you're up.

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:40.240
Mr. Wang,

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:41.700
you must have given it
a pretty weak shake.

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:45.380
Now my fate is literally a blank slate.

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:46.520
Mr. Lin.

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:48.640
I'll go last.

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:49.580
Sure.

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:51.120
I'll go, then.

00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:56.800
Alright.

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:57.860
Come on everyone.

00:40:57.860 --> 00:40:58.220
Come on.

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:00.020
I'll pick one.

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:00.660
Let me get in on this too.

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:04.800
Nothing for me.

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:05.360
My turn.

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:06.780
Is it this one?

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:07.620
Foodie.

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:10.700
[Foodie]
Totally fits you.

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:12.220
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:13.760
That's the one.

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:14.880
Alright,

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:17.100
there's only one tasting slot left.

00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:19.120
It's between Mr. Lin

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:20.960
and Nie.

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:22.360
The final face-off.

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:23.600
Who

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.040
is going to be the lucky foodie

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:26.060
of Administration?

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:31.420
Let's do it together.

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:32.820
Okay.

Foodie.

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:51.980
Shoot.
