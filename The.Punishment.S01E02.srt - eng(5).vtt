Let go of me!

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.510
I must take my revenge!

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.030
You're really beyond my control now.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.230
Give me back my knife!

Give me my knife!

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.800
Who do you think you are now?
What do you want the knife for?

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.440
Take revenge, huh?

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.430
What is this for?

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:24.710
Tell me!

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.030
What happened?

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.510
When we were selling chicken
in the market,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.280
those from Zhao Village bullied us again.

You're not my mother!

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:43.880
Who are you to tell me what to do?

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.240
My mother already died!

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:50.470

Just listen to Mom.

Mom!

Uncle,
Director Chen and Mayor Wu are here.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:33.950
Mr. Ma.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.450
Hello. Long time no see.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.520
Hello, Director Chen.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.430
Welcome.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.079
Last time, I didn't think

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.960
you had fun hunting.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.360
I've specially selected
a few guns this time.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.000
Have a try.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.750
I'm sure all your guns are good, Mr. Ma.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:49.470
But now

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.870
the problem
is that shooting habits is banned.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.400
Even the best gun is useless
without a target.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.540
Director Chen, Mr. Ma,

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.430
Longwan is like a little rabbit

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.030
that certainly cannot escape
from your grasp.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.590
Mayor Wu,

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.330
the thing is,

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.820
Longwan the rabbit is unwilling to talk.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.120
Shouldn't you do something as the mayor?

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.800
Director Chen,

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.150
I've wanted to secure this land
for a long time.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.410
But Madam Wen and her followers
are difficult to deal with.

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.070
If they refuse to talk,

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.190
then just quit.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.120
Leave it as it is.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.390

please rest assured.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.070

I'll help.

Isn't it time to hand it over?

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.750
Still trying to hold out?

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.870
Tianye,

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.190
I don't think

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.520
we should do this alone.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.270

Let's go for it
now that you've prepared everything.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.830
The current problem doesn't lie in

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.040
qualifications.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.520
This is indeed

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.630
a lucrative business.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.230
Everyone wants a share of it.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:22.360
However, Tianye,

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.330
have you considered this?

Those people have been operating
in Hanzhou for many years.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.600
They're really something.

Uncle Limin, I know they're formidable.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.510
But are we just supposed to take abuse?

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.480
What abuse?

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.070
Fine, this may sound harsh to you:

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:37.510
How did Feng's parents die?

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:38.480
How did Yan's parents

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.240
and my father

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:39.920
die?

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.970
We've been bullied all along.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.610
Everyone sees us as easy targets.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:46.920
Uncle Limin,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.750
have you ever

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.810
thought about why they want our land?

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.190
Let's suppose this is Hanzhou,

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:53.890
alright?

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.270
This is Hanzhou Port.

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.830
And this is Longwan, alright?

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.600
When national highways, provincial roads,

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.920
and cargo ports are built and connected,

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.560
the local economy will soar.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:02.480
By then, this place

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.240
will no longer be a small fishing village.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.160
Instead, it will be

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.950
the economic center of Hanzhou.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:08.240
E-Everyone's fighting over this land.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.170
Why should we sit on the sidelines?

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.000
Tianye has a point.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:15.870
That's all well and good,

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.360
but we don't have money.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.130
Then let's work it out.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.440
If we really go for it,

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:23.610
will Zhao Village cooperate?

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:25.850
I don't trust them.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:26.950
Look, Jiangyong,

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:28.100
let's give it a try.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.120
How do we know if we don't try?

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.830
You still don't understand what I mean.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:31.560
What Zhao Village?

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.159
That's not the real problem.

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:35.240
You know what?

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.000
I've heard Mayor Wu

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:38.720
and Jinding Group

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.310
are in collusion.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:41.070
And that Chen...

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:41.750
What's he called?

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:42.870
-"Director Chen."
-"Director Chen."

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:43.670
Yes, it's him.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.750
I've discovered today

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.960
that he is biased and partial.

00:07:47.159 --> 00:07:49.120
We can't fight them off.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.600
Look,
if you are to make something of yourself,

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.000
you have to fight others.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.750
We cannot miss out on

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.800
what everyone is going for.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:56.720
I can't argue with you.

Don't rush.

What we are

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.040
doing is gambling,

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:04.610
with our lives.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.660
I'll be the first to take the risk.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.870
Who are you risking your life against now?

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:09.920
Cut it out.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.600
You're too old to be so childish.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.160
-Uncle Limin. Why are you all here today?
-Feng.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.390
What is it with you?

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.510
You didn't come back
for the ancestral worship ceremony.

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:19.720
I was really held up

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.120
by something today,

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.320
so I couldn't make it.

During today's ceremony,

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.240
Luo Bo and his people
came to mess with us again.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.500
Luo Bo showed up again?

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:32.270
It's like he's everywhere.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:33.000
What did he come for?

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.750
I was just talking with Uncle Limin
about these matters...

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.200
Alright. Stop it.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.390
It was no big deal.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:38.960
You must be hungry, right?

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.870
I saved you some food from the ceremony.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:41.799
I'm also hungry.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.840
Okay. I'll reheat it.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.120
Everyone, stay for dinner.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:45.630
No need.

We're leaving.

You should both

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.790
stay and eat with us,

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:50.270
so I can have a proper discussion
with you.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:50.960
Okay then.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.510
I heard your conversation

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:53.630
just now.

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.690
You may resume it some other time.

-Alright.
-We're leaving.

Take care.

-Sure.
-Take care, Uncle Limin.

I'll go reheat the food.

What's the matter, Tianye?

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.030
Your fish is ready. Eat while it's hot.

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:17.400
Thanks, Mom.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.670
Come eat.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.150
The fish smells amazing.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:22.150
I smelt it from far away.

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:23.270
You did?

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:26.030
He refused to let me make it

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:27.960
and insisted on cooking it for you.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.550
You insisted on cooking it for me?

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.270

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.720
you said Luo Bo stopped by today.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.580
What happened?

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.150
He brought a bunch of people
to cause trouble.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:52.720
I think

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.360
he did it just to spite us.

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:56.950
What was the trouble?

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.720
Did they assault

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.650
and hurt anyone?

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:00.080
No, they didn't.

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:03.470
They just brought
many prominent figures here

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.200
and voiced their views
about our ancestral hall,

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.660
declaring to tear it down.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:09.910
They really got some nerve.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.200

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.440
They threatened and sweet talked,

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:15.490
How can we let them have their way?

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.150
Why should we rent it to them?

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:18.320
That's our own land.

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:19.910
We can do whatever we want with it,

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:20.510
right?

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:22.240
Even if we are to rent it out,
it won't be to them.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.640
They're not good people.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.240
Actually,
I don't think it's a serious issue.

right?

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:33.960
I think

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.690
that's a nice place
to set up a logistics company.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.120
What do you think?

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:40.750
Is that your plan?

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:44.790
It sounds good,

doesn't it?

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.480
Why let others develop the land

Go to the power supply bureau
to figure it out now, okay?
