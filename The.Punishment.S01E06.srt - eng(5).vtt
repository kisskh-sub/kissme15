[Hanzhou City, 2002]

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.190
That person

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.440
was indeed pushed by you

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.160
and hit his head.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.960
Now he's dead.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.800
There's no way you can explain it.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.070
Tell me,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.440
what should we do?

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:27.770
What else can we do?

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.800
There's no video footage,
so I can't explain it clearly.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.520
And I admit I pushed him.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.940
As an experienced detective,

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.810
how could you be so impulsive?

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.310
I was too frustrated
to control myself!

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.960
I know you feel wronged,

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.240
but what should we do?

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.800
What am I supposed to do?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.460
At worst, we'll have to
follow the protocol.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.400
What about Xiaoyue and Qin Feng?

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.390
How can we just drop

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.470
Xu Li's case like this?

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.070
Let's put that aside for now.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.470
Let's focus on you!

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.000
You all laid hands on him!

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.790
Well, now

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.810
you're all responsible!

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:06.070
You're supposed to be their senior!

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.870
It's because I'm their senior

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.280
that I'll take
full responsibility for this!

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.430
It has nothing to do
with Xiaoyue or Qin Feng.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.960
What kind of mentor are you?

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:18.450
Director Wang.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.870
Well,

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.930
is there still room for negotiation?

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.860
I mean,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.710
can we settle it privately?

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.310
Stop saying that.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.300
The higher-ups in the city
have called me several times.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.130
This incident is too significant
to cover up.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.850
Let's follow the protocol.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.590
Got it.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.400
The director said

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.920
we should handle Mai's matter

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.250
according to protocol,

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.229
which means

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.620
we'll do what must be done.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.479
Well,

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.210
what about Qin Feng and Hu Xiaoyue?

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.640
Send Qin Feng to the police station.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.080
Hu Xiaoyue bears less responsibility.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.740
Give him a disciplinary warning

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.470
and let him reflect on himself.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.250

You asked me out to exercise at noon.

Well,

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.020
I've caught a cold lately.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.630
I have ringing in the ears

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:59.630
and a stuffy nose.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.910
You're really a slick old man.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.960
You're good in every way,

you're too candid, you know?

That's just who I am.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.590
What is Director Ye really thinking?

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.519
I think

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.399
there are still some doubts

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.519
about Wang Ming's case.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.820
You're being paranoid

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.440
and making things up.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.920
Why overthink it?

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.740
Don't get yourself in trouble, okay?

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.560
I've always wanted to ask you something.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.360
What is it?

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.730
Just tell me. Stop acting mysterious.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.950
Before Hu Xiaoyue got into trouble,

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.000
he talked to you.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.720
Did he tell you anything?

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.510
Yes.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.700
He did talk to me.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.680
But it was just a normal work report.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.400
I don't think there was anything

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.690
unusual about him.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.040

anything about Wang Ming's case?

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.950
Not a word.

About his suicide,

What's wrong?

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.350
I'm getting old,

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:35.800
and my legs

You refused to see
the rehabilitation doctor I recommended.

As you grow older,

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.460
it's getting worse.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.060
I wouldn't worry about that.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:54.360
Didn't you

promise to take care of me
when I'm old?

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:57.750
When I got injured,

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.560
you cried so hard,

for the rest of my life.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.240
Of course!

Bear with it.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.130
Adjust it a bit more.

about this?

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.050
At least we could share his burden.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.040

for what happened back then.

What are you making?

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.060
I'm making mantis shrimp.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.240
I was planning to make stir-fried crab.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.170
Then come in and make it.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.850
What a coincidence.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.950
They're big, aren't they?

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:21.950
They all have roe.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.560
What's wrong?
Is there something on your mind?

No.

No?

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.310
You must be worrying about the case.

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.000
If you can't talk about it,
I won't ask, okay?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.240
But if there's anything else,
just tell me.

okay?

Fine.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.030
I'll cook the crab.

No need.

I made some crab.

My brother made that dish.

Which one do you like?

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.850
I like all of them!

Come on, let's eat.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.120
It's rare for everyone
to be home together like this,

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:05.870
and you've been busy preparing food.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:06.630
Here, eat more.

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:08.160
Thank you, sister-in-law.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.390
Why didn't you bring Xiaobo back?

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:11.920
I already sent him back to school.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.580
He should stay a few more days.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.410
Most of our family is here today,

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.160
so I'd like to say a few words.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.640
I've almost recovered,

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.390
and the farm in Longwan has been closed.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.070
I think we need to discuss

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.290
what we should do in the future.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:28.920
Perhaps I'm getting old,

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.180
but I can still work for a few years.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:30.830
No, you're not old

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:31.710
at all.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.480
Besides, this isn't the first time

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.480
we've faced this situation.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.840
It doesn't matter what we do.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.390
As long as we focus on living our lives,

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:39.870
nothing else matters.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.510
God is watching from above,

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:43.080
and bad people will get what they deserve,

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:43.789
right?

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:44.270
Yes.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.120
Come on.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.870
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:57.030
Yan.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.210
Now that you've taken care of
things at home,

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:03.190
when are you going back
to the provincial capital?

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:03.960
I'm

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:05.730
not going back.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:07.870
Are you staying here?

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.120
You're a well-educated
law school student.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.360
You should at least become a lawyer

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.600
or a civil servant.

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:16.290
I'd rather stay at home

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:18.550
working for my family

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:20.240
than work for others.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:21.910
Why are you looking at me?

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:23.640
Do you think I have a job for you?

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.550
Wait, you...

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:26.420
I'm not joking. I'm serious.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:29.270
Now that Hanzhou
is focusing on economic development,

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:30.910
with the boost from Hanzhou Port,

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:31.980
Hanzhou's economy

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:33.630
will definitely see rapid growth.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:34.510
I agree.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.870
With many opportunities at our hometown,

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:38.650
why should I go elsewhere?

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:39.720
Don't you think so, Mom?

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.750
Look at her.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.480
Well,

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:42.630
a college student

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:43.750
speaks differently.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:44.320
She's got high awareness.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.150
So articulate.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:45.630
Of course.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:46.750
However,

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.360
what do the things you say

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.090
have to do with your law degree?

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:52.280
Of course they're related.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.910
When our family business

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.510
grows bigger,

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:56.960
we'll need a legal team.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.060
Do you understand

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.080
legal contracts?

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:01.600
-Yes.
-Okay.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.440
You'll be our legal director, okay?

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.030
Legal director.

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:05.380
But in my opinion,

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:06.320
with all your knowledge,

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.550
shouldn't you go out
and test your skills?

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.360
Don't use our family business
as your training ground.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.910
We can't afford more mistakes.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.140
Mom, look at him!

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.120
Well,

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.910
I need to grow alongside

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:17.480
our family business, right?

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.510
You have ambition.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:19.270
You don't trust me.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:19.910
Fine.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:21.240
You'll be our legal director,

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:21.720
okay?

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.160
Okay.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:24.510
Assign me some staff.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:25.850
You want staff?

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.810
Get the work done quickly.

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:29.460
[Delete]

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:29.610
Your brother is so unreliable,

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:30.720
[Delete Message]

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:33.600
making you a legal director.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.350
There's not a legal team yet.

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.480
Luo Bo

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.110
is too extroverted

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:29.750
and flashy.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.470
He got lucky this time,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.460
but will he get off that easily next time?

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:39.600
Mr. Ma,

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:41.600
why not let Song Hao

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:44.190
handle some of the tasks?

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.490
Give him a chance to gain experience.

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:49.250
What do you think?

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:50.670
Did you hear that?

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.390
Your father-in-law just said it.

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:53.240
From now on,

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:54.790
don't complain about
having too many tasks.

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:55.520
Understand?

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.220
It's my honor

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.780
to get this opportunity
to gain experience.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:00.720
Actually,

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:03.830
I also think he's got great potential.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:04.670
Look,

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:07.910
he has good education
and strong abilities.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:10.960
However,

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:14.630
don't take this the wrong way.

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:16.600
Sometimes, you're still

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.000
a bit

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.960
less experienced than Luo Bo.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:23.400
But it's okay.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:24.510
Work hard.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.240
Don't let us down.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.520
Don't let Mr. Ma down.

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:30.470
Mr. Ma, rest assured.

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:32.670
I won't disappoint you.

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:34.390
Bo

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.360
acts decisively,

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:38.960
and sometimes he can be a bit reckless.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.080
But don't worry.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:42.360
I'll coordinate well with him.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.240
Well,

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:49.440
about Ye Tianyou's nephew,

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.110
you need to help him.

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.360
I don't care how you do it.

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:56.640
I only want results.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:00.480
Mr. Ma,

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.670
I heard that Mr. Ye
isn't married yet, right?

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:05.440
I don't think so.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.520
What's wrong?

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.330
Young people

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:09.820
can be reckless when having fun

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.680
and easily get into trouble.

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:16.470
Got it.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.000
Go handle it.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:25.710
Here, come on!

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:26.720
Stop right here!

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.940
Get out of the car! Hurry!

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:30.600
Wait...

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.670
-There's something important.
-What's so urgent?

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:33.320
Someone

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.200
is looking for you.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:34.750
Hurry!

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:35.390
Who is it?

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:36.910
Just come with me.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.440
What's going on?

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.240
He's already here.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.750
Let me take a look. Calm down.

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:43.600
Take it easy.

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:44.870
Let me take a look.

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:52.320
What's wrong?

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:53.630
Is he really Director Ye's nephew?

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:55.150
Listen, Director Ye
told us to stay out of this.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:55.790
I can't handle it.

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:57.120
Don't cause me trouble.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.720
What does this have to do with me?

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.440
He specifically asked for you.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.270
Don't ask me.

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:03.360
Listen, ask

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.910
our captain,

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:05.630
and he can handle it.

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:06.440
Please don't!

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.270
I don't care.

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.000
You have to help me settle this.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.150
Well, what's the situation now?

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:12.350
How bad is the injury?

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.580
It's not that serious.

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:16.030
If it's not serious, just handle it.

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:16.750
Why are you asking me?

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.270
They wanted an apology,

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:19.730
but he just wouldn't do it.

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:21.120
He wouldn't apologize?

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.680
Then I can't help you.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.220
Ye Siyuan,

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:28.160
the person you're looking for is here.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.150
Siyuan.

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:35.040
You ignored me, didn't you?

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:38.080
How could you ignore me, Qin Feng?

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.060
I called you so many times.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.680
What took you so long?

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:42.510
Hurry up.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.840
Get me out of here.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:45.980
They ganged up on me!

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.360
Where's justice?

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.200
Enough!

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:49.950
You insulted them first,

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:50.720
and you fought back.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.870
This is a slugfest, understand?

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:52.790
Slugfest?

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.050
Ridiculous.

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:57.200
-They pointed at me and insulted me!
-Enough.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.750
I was just defending myself!

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:00.600
Don't shout in the station.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.200
What do you expect Chief Zhang to do?

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.000
Right?

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.890
Well, Chief Zhang,
what's the situation now?

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.820
They want mediation

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.490
and need an apology.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.120
That's easy.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.250
Just apologize, and this will be over.

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:17.510
Who? Me?

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:18.240
I apologize?

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.030
Why?

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:20.910
Why should I...

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:22.630
Why should I apologize?

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:24.600
Why should I apologize to them?

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:25.840
What did I do wrong?

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.000
They ganged up on me!
How is this my fault?

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:28.510
Listen,

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:29.630
even though they didn't hurt me...

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:30.720
I've trained in freestyle fighting,

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.200
-so I dodged their moves!
-Enough!

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.150
Why should I apologize to them?

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.510
You...

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.320
A wise man knows
when to back down, right?

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.510
Just apologize to them.

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:41.150
It makes things easier
for Chief Zhang too.

Did Director Ye ask you to do this?

What's the background of this company?

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.400
You two

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.660
should report to your supervisor first.

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:13.410
This company's owner

The owner is called Song Hao,

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:25.270
and his father-in-law, Wang Xu,

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:27.350

You must follow proper procedures.

By the way,

Wang Ming's case

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.400
has nothing to do with me.

I'm not being a coward.

00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:17.480
How did it go?

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:19.890
I think it went well.

00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:22.750
The matter of Longwan

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.650
is pretty much settled.

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:27.570
Now it's time for you to step in

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:28.910
and pull some strings

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:31.160
to get the approval document
for the land in Longwan

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:32.440
as soon as possible.

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:37.280
Let's figure out

00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:38.340
how to coordinate.

00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:43.750
Captain Zhong,

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:45.440
you went to Dynasty
for dinner yesterday, right?

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:45.880
Yes,

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:46.060
we had a class reunion

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:46.920
[Hanzhou Public Security Bureau]

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:47.800
there.

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:50.550
Your class reunion is quite high-end.

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.700
It's not strange
that some of them are businessmen.

00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:57.040
How did you know?

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:00.570
That's why I'm here.

00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:02.540
Yesterday,

00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:04.390
Song Hao and I

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:06.360
happened to pass by and saw you.

00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:08.180
Song Hao

00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:09.280
went to see Luo Bo,

00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:11.270
but there was someone

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.330
hard to deal with.

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:14.170
Who?

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:19.860
Ye Siyuan.

00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:23.680
Ye Siyuan, Director Ye's nephew?

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:27.950
[Hanzhou Public Security Bureau]

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:34.150
What's going on? Tell me.

00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:36.990
Well, we were just
doing routine surveillance.

00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:38.230
I didn't notice at first.

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:39.890
But when I checked the photos,

00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:41.070
I recognized him.

00:42:41.110 --> 00:42:41.670
Look.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.200
The one in the middle.

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:46.150
It's really him.

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:55.920
Captain Zhong, don't worry.

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:57.810
If it...

00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:59.490
Why are you tearing it up?

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:00.970
If it puts you in a difficult position,
I'll pretend I didn't see him.

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:02.500
It's not about my position.

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:03.830
We have to report this,

00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:05.470
but not now.
