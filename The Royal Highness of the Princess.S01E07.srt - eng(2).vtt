00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.760
Thank you all for today.

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:56.560
Without the reputation of the Yunmi Four Young Masters,

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.040
we wouldn't have had such a crowd today.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.439
Commander He.

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:02.120
Have you fully recovered?

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.400
Just a minor injury.

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:06.439
It's completely fine now.

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.039
But you should still avoid drinking today.

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:11.120
Alright.

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:13.680
As expected of Commander He.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.800
Every move has the bearing of a great general.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.360
Truly the male lead.

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:23.439
Opening a tavern and still getting the Yunmi Four Young Masters to preside.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.879
Brother Meng.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.199
I prepared this especially for you.

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:29.159
Ordinary people would be drunk after one cup,

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:31.560
perfect for someone like you who can drink a thousand cups without getting drunk.

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.639
Thank you, Zixiu.

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:34.319
Seventh Cousin.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.039
You and Young Master Meng...

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.919
Before this,

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:39.960
I was almost tricked into buying a fake painting.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.879
Luckily, Shaojue helped me see through it.

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.639
We hit it off immediately

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:44.919
and became friends.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.560
These are letters for Young Master Meng from the young ladies.

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.879
Enjoy the food and drinks!

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.800
Alright, alright, alright.

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:23.319
I'll take my leave now.

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.840
Eldest Brother.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.840
Wait a moment.

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:29.439
Everyone!

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:32.759
Thank you all for coming today.

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:33.719
Today,

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.199
I have prepared quite a few surprises for everyone.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.000
Surprises?

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:39.280
Shao Jue.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.120
Here.

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.479
Good, good, good.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.280
If we sell five hundred jars of wine today,

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.080
there will be a second major surprise.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.000
There's another surprise?

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.919
There's another surprise?

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:09.400
Sell one thousand jars,

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:13.120
and there will be a third, once-in-a-century surprise.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.079
Great, great, great!

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.199
Everyone, eat and drink to your heart's content,

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.360
and have a great time!

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.759
Great, great, great!

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:22.240
Come on.

00:04:23.079 --> 00:04:24.360
Come on, come on, come on.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.360
You don't hold your liquor well.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.519
Have some tea.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.279
Fine.

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.839
Young Master Meng.

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:42.240
Who is that person?

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.720
Young Master Guan, the son of the Guan household.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.319
You should stay away from him.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.319
So that's Guan Yue.

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:49.800
Miss, you know him?

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:51.839
Not exactly.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.920
I've just heard the servants in the mansion talk about him.

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:56.839
His grandfather is a respected elder who served three emperors.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.879
He is held in high esteem by the Emperor.

00:04:59.079 --> 00:05:00.480
His father is Prefect Guan of the capital.

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:02.480
Relying on his family's power and status,

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.319
he struts around the capital,

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:05.279
acting like a tyrant.

00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:09.199
I heard a few days ago he harassed a woman on the street

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.759
and even got beaten up by my brother.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.079
I've heard Young Master Meng's swordsmanship is superb.

00:05:14.519 --> 00:05:18.399
I, Guan, wish to have a match with you.

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:33.399
Unfortunately,

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.920
this young master is not feeling well today.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.959
I don't wish to compete.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.319
Is Young Master Meng perhaps afraid?

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:43.360
Guan Yue!

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:45.480
This is my turf.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.759
Get the hell away from here.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.319
Zixiu.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.399
Since Master Guan insists on a match,

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.560
it's not impossible.

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:56.680
If you lose,

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.800
you must buy one thousand jars of fine wine from the Drunk Immortal Inn today.

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:02.800
No problem.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.639
And if Young Master Meng loses,

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:06.879
what then?

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.600
Whatever you want.

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:09.879
Good.

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:11.360
If you lose,

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.399
you must, in front of everyone,

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:14.360
kowtow to me with a loud thud. How about that?

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:17.240
It's a deal.

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:31.000
This one thousand jars of fine wine

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.439
shall be considered a congratulatory gift for the Drunk Immortal Inn's opening.

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:35.120
Brother Meng, you're a true friend.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.959
Don't you find it strange?

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.000
I clearly poisoned the wine,

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:42.800
so why can I still use my internal energy?

00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:56.720
I...

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:07.680
Young Master!

00:08:07.879 --> 00:08:08.360
Are you alright?

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.439
Next time, I won't be so kind.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.160
Get lost!

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:23.319
Young Master!

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.560
This Guan Yue really needs to be taught a lesson.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:31.639
Someone!

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.320
Go investigate how he poisoned the wine.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:36.960
From now on, he is not to set foot in my tavern.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.039
Yes.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.120
Young Master Xiu.

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:41.000
The one thousand jars of wine have been sold.

00:08:41.399 --> 00:08:42.639
What about the other two surprises?

00:08:42.639 --> 00:08:44.039
Shouldn't you show them to us?

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.200
Yes, yes!

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.360
Right? Show them to us!

00:08:46.679 --> 00:08:48.200
Exactly, let us see!

00:08:48.559 --> 00:08:49.039
Let's see!

00:08:52.039 --> 00:08:52.480
Eldest Brother.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.360
I told you long ago,

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.639
Shao Jue is a righteous and honorable person.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.559
You two should have a drink

00:08:58.799 --> 00:08:59.480
and have a good chat.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.440
Perhaps

00:09:00.759 --> 00:09:01.759
you can become good brothers.

00:09:02.879 --> 00:09:03.720
Absolutely impossible.

00:09:09.679 --> 00:09:10.440
Seventh Cousin.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.240
Could it be that the other two banners

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.080
are related to the two of them?

00:09:16.399 --> 00:09:17.080
Young Master Xiu!

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.720
Quickly, take down that banner!

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.240
Yes, right? Take it down!

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.600
Take it down and let us see!

00:09:22.519 --> 00:09:23.679
What exactly is written on it?

00:09:24.559 --> 00:09:25.320
Open it quickly!

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.600
Let us see what it is!

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.200
Yes, yes, let us have a look!

00:09:29.799 --> 00:09:30.480
We're all waiting!

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.679
I didn't expect

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.759
Guan Yue would actually buy one thousand jars of wine.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.759
Absolutely impossible.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.720
They're not going to fight, are they?

00:10:18.639 --> 00:10:19.960
Even if they did, it wouldn't be here and now.

00:10:20.919 --> 00:10:22.000
I don't know Meng Shaojue well.

00:10:22.759 --> 00:10:25.039
But I know exactly how my elder cousin treats you.

00:10:25.919 --> 00:10:26.799
Since he's here,

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.440
he would never ruin your event.

00:10:31.759 --> 00:10:32.600
Miss.

00:10:33.559 --> 00:10:36.960
Are Lord Yu Wen and our young master enemies?

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:38.200
Not exactly.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.679
My brother and Lord Yu Wen

00:10:39.679 --> 00:10:41.000
just don't see eye to eye.

00:11:04.679 --> 00:11:06.480
If Meng Shaojue had agreed to serve in court back then,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.080
he'd probably be in a high position now,

00:11:09.399 --> 00:11:10.440
just like Lord Yu Wen.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:13.879
Miss.

00:11:14.159 --> 00:11:15.480
Our young master was the top scholar.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.759
Why didn't he become an official?

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.000
Why do you, a blockhead, care so much?

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:45.840
Azi.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.840
Later, I'll pretend to be drunk.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:48.720
You take me away first.

00:11:50.039 --> 00:11:50.679
What did you say?

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:51.679
I can't hear you.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.360
I said I'll pretend to be drunk, you take me away first.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.879
It's finally over. It's finally over.

00:12:34.559 --> 00:12:35.720
How could this happen?

00:12:38.559 --> 00:12:40.000
What on earth is going on?

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:46.840
Young Master Xiu.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.200
What does this final banner

00:12:49.799 --> 00:12:50.799
say?

00:12:54.799 --> 00:12:55.960
Seventh Cousin is a bit drunk.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.279
I'll take him back first.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:58.639
Alright.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:12:59.559
Let's go.

00:13:08.759 --> 00:13:10.039
Really?

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.159
Alone with the Chief Minister?

00:13:14.559 --> 00:13:16.080
Heavens!

00:13:19.279 --> 00:13:20.279
This is allowed?

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.720
Alone together, yes!

00:13:24.799 --> 00:13:25.279
Big Brother.

00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:27.120
Just treat it like tossing the embroidered ball!

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.600
Don't miss this golden opportunity.

00:13:34.679 --> 00:13:35.519
Pick me! Pick me! Pick me!

00:13:35.519 --> 00:13:37.039
Quick, quick! Pick me! Pick me!

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.440
It's rare to see Yu Wen Rui like this.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.679
Pick me! Pick me!

00:13:43.039 --> 00:13:45.039
My lord, look at me! My lord!

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.679
My lord is truly blessed with good fortune.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.399
Commander He, I'll take my leave now.

00:13:59.639 --> 00:14:00.919
Meng Shaojue is leaving already?

00:14:05.799 --> 00:14:08.120
My lord! My lord! My lord!

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.080
My lord, look at me!

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.240
Pick me! Pick me!

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.639
Toss it to me, my lord!

00:14:11.639 --> 00:14:13.039
Pick me, my lord!

00:14:13.039 --> 00:14:14.960
Toss it to me, my lord!

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.360
Over here! Over here!

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.039
Pick me! Toss it to me!

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.360
Look at Lord Yu Wen holding that ball.

00:14:33.679 --> 00:14:35.399
It's like he's holding a murderous hammer.

00:14:41.919 --> 00:14:42.799
She caught it!

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.000
Oh my!

00:14:46.519 --> 00:14:48.360
Is this young lady stunned with joy?

00:14:48.559 --> 00:14:49.240
Come, come!

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.080
A private room upstairs is ready for you.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:51.720
Miss.

00:14:53.399 --> 00:14:53.919
Alan.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:11.759
Young lady.

00:15:11.879 --> 00:15:13.679
Lord Yu Wen doesn't like women who are too forward.

00:15:14.159 --> 00:15:14.840
Indeed.

00:15:15.159 --> 00:15:16.919
Before, a woman threw herself at him

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.279
and he had her thrown out.

00:15:18.679 --> 00:15:19.600
You should be careful.

00:15:20.519 --> 00:15:21.039
Young lady.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.000
Then we'll be going now.

00:15:50.919 --> 00:15:53.039
M-my lord.

00:15:54.039 --> 00:15:56.080
I came out behind my husband's back.

00:15:56.519 --> 00:15:58.159
I can't let others see my true face.

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:07.960
Behind your husband's back,

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.759
drinking and merrymaking with another man?

00:16:12.519 --> 00:16:14.120
You're quite bold.

00:16:15.639 --> 00:16:16.519
So, my lord,

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.639
if my husband finds out,

00:16:18.919 --> 00:16:20.000
he'll surely be angry.

00:16:20.519 --> 00:16:22.519
Perhaps we should meet another day.

00:16:23.639 --> 00:16:25.200
Afraid of your husband's anger,

00:16:25.879 --> 00:16:27.440
but not afraid of mine?

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:34.720
Since my lord puts it that way,

00:16:35.039 --> 00:16:37.279
I'll respectfully comply.

00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:50.840
My lord, let me feed you.

00:16:58.679 --> 00:16:59.519
My lord.

00:17:00.919 --> 00:17:01.919
You don't know...

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.960
I've actually been waiting for this day

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.519
for a very long time.

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:15.799
My lord seems

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:20.480
not as unapproachable as the rumors say.

00:17:28.839 --> 00:17:29.839
Why did you stop?

00:17:32.279 --> 00:17:34.359
Wasn't it said Yu Wen Rui dislikes forward women?

00:17:39.759 --> 00:17:40.680
Unhand my lord!

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:04.839
Fifth Princess.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:06.079
This...

00:18:10.359 --> 00:18:10.880
Out.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:12.640
Yes.

00:18:25.119 --> 00:18:27.440
So you knew it was me all along?

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.119
You knew it was me.

00:18:36.599 --> 00:18:38.039
Why did you still toss the ball to me?

00:18:41.839 --> 00:18:42.400
A mistake.

00:18:44.559 --> 00:18:45.519
What mistake?

00:18:45.759 --> 00:18:47.119
I think you deliberately teased me.

00:18:50.559 --> 00:18:51.359
I tossed it...

00:18:53.839 --> 00:18:54.680
that ball...

00:18:55.039 --> 00:18:56.920
to choose a woman to drink and have fun with.

00:18:57.839 --> 00:18:59.119
You seemed quite happy.

00:18:59.799 --> 00:19:00.480
No.

00:19:00.799 --> 00:19:02.039
How could I be?

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.000
I heard that recently,

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.839
the Fifth Princess asked the Meng residence

00:19:07.839 --> 00:19:09.279
for a little black pig.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.960
And now you secretly went to the Meng residence again.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.839
You told me you were just going to have fun.

00:19:20.079 --> 00:19:21.240
To tell you the truth,

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:24.119
I went specifically for that little black pig.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:35.400
Brother.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:36.200
It's bad!

00:19:57.519 --> 00:19:58.640
It really was for a pig?

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:01.480
Of course.

00:20:02.799 --> 00:20:06.599
Xiao Hei is handsome and cute.

00:20:07.319 --> 00:20:08.920
His complexion is so healthy.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:12.119
I like him so much.

00:20:18.359 --> 00:20:19.920
Xiao Hei.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.759
Xiao Hei.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.799
Xiao Hei.

00:20:29.599 --> 00:20:30.319
Good boy.

00:20:30.559 --> 00:20:34.559
Come, come to sister's arms.

00:20:50.599 --> 00:20:52.759
Meng Shaojue, my lord is handling important business.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.240
You cannot enter.

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.920
I never thought the esteemed Chief Minister was this kind of man.

00:21:13.799 --> 00:21:14.240
Blockhead.

00:21:15.519 --> 00:21:16.160
Wake up.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:17.839
Blockhead.

00:21:20.799 --> 00:21:21.319
Come.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.720
A person of my Meng residence

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.160
cannot be bullied by others.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.000
Whether he's a person of your Meng residence

00:21:34.759 --> 00:21:36.000
is not for you to decide.

00:21:36.799 --> 00:21:37.920
What does my lord mean by that?

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.480
This blockhead is so heavy.

00:21:52.559 --> 00:21:53.759
Miss.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.039
Young Master

00:22:00.799 --> 00:22:02.000
You fool, you're nothing but trouble.

00:22:02.319 --> 00:22:03.880
This time, I will definitely kick you out of the mansion.

00:22:06.319 --> 00:22:07.440
Miss

00:22:08.119 --> 00:22:11.519
My father used to work for the He family.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.839
I know a lot about Commander He.

00:22:15.839 --> 00:22:16.640
Really?

00:22:17.279 --> 00:22:18.160
Tell me quickly.

00:22:19.119 --> 00:22:20.119
Miss

00:22:20.559 --> 00:22:22.599
A'Lan wants to take care of Little Black.

00:22:23.519 --> 00:22:24.680
Isn't that just taking care of pigs?

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:25.839
No problem.

00:22:25.839 --> 00:22:27.200
The four pigs in the backyard are all yours.

00:22:28.759 --> 00:22:29.799
I trust you.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:30.839
That's why I'm giving you this important task.

00:22:31.519 --> 00:22:32.920
You must take good care of them.

00:22:33.799 --> 00:22:34.359
Come on, come on.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.759
Quickly, tell me about Commander He.

00:22:43.359 --> 00:22:43.839
Sir

00:22:44.279 --> 00:22:46.200
Why did the Fifth Princess go to the Meng mansion to be a maid?

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.519
Sugar figurines for sale!

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.319
Pendants, ornaments!

00:22:50.319 --> 00:22:50.880
Sir

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.480
I think the Fifth Princess is...

00:22:52.599 --> 00:22:53.839
...truly devoted to you.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:56.599
What makes you say that?

00:22:57.559 --> 00:22:58.480
Look, sir.

00:22:59.359 --> 00:23:01.440
You just asked the Fifth Princess to find a way to cancel the engagement.

00:23:01.759 --> 00:23:02.839
Then she secretly slipped out of the palace.

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.079
Clearly to avoid this matter.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:06.519
And now?

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.640
Now, in order to get close to you,

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.279
she deliberately wears a veil to hide her identity.

00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:15.400
Such devotion.

00:23:17.279 --> 00:23:18.480
Find a few cute little pigs.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:19.720
Pigs?

00:23:20.359 --> 00:23:22.079
Sir, you want to raise pigs?

00:23:26.759 --> 00:23:27.279
Sir

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:45.599
Little Black

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:47.319
Little Black

00:23:49.039 --> 00:23:49.680
Little Black

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.240
You girl!

00:23:55.359 --> 00:23:56.440
What are you doing in the young master's room?

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.119
I'm bringing lotus seed soup for the young master.

00:24:02.279 --> 00:24:03.240
What lotus seed soup?

00:24:03.799 --> 00:24:05.400
You clearly just want to get close to the young master.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.240
I'm warning you.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.559
Don't forget your place.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.720
I am the young lady's maid.

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:13.799
Good that you know.

00:24:15.319 --> 00:24:18.119
Then what is Sister Keqing's status?

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:20.759
I am, of course, also the young master's mai...

00:24:23.079 --> 00:24:26.359
So Sister Keqing is also a maid.

00:24:26.759 --> 00:24:27.200
You!

00:24:28.799 --> 00:24:30.720
I think you, this fool, are nothing but a jinx.

00:24:31.079 --> 00:24:33.039
Staying in the mansion only causes trouble for the young master and lady.

00:24:35.319 --> 00:24:36.759
I heard from Guard Xu.

00:24:37.559 --> 00:24:38.799
Yesterday at the Drunk Immortal Inn,

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.279
if he hadn't gone back to save you,

00:24:40.559 --> 00:24:42.599
the young master would have caught Shuncai and retrieved the dagger.

00:24:50.359 --> 00:24:51.359
Young Master

00:24:52.799 --> 00:24:53.480
You may leave first.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:54.960
Yes.

00:25:00.559 --> 00:25:02.720
That was quite an eye-opener for me just now.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.000
A fool who actually knows how to tease people.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.039
Young Master, I am not a fool.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.000
Oh, "not a fool," is it?

00:25:19.319 --> 00:25:20.839
Weren't you bringing me lotus seed soup?

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:21.640
Well?

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:22.920
Aren't you going to bring it over?

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.759
Yesterday at the Drunk Immortal Inn,

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.839
someone secretly told me the wine was poisoned.

00:25:41.559 --> 00:25:42.880
But they refused to reveal their identity.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:55.960
Look.

00:25:56.359 --> 00:25:57.000
What is this?

00:26:07.319 --> 00:26:08.359
Little Black's tail.

00:26:12.079 --> 00:26:13.799
A dagger was deliberately drawn on the envelope.

00:26:14.359 --> 00:26:15.599
To get my attention.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.119
But those who know I'm looking for the dagger...

00:26:19.559 --> 00:26:21.440
...are few even within the Meng mansion.

00:26:24.519 --> 00:26:26.480
Why do I find you more and more unfathomable?

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.680
Say you're stupid,

00:26:29.519 --> 00:26:31.240
yet you're full of strangeness.

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.960
Say you're not stupid,

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.599
yet you wear the face of a fool.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.680
No matter how I look, you look foolish.

00:26:45.839 --> 00:26:46.319
Young Master

00:26:46.519 --> 00:26:47.079
The four little pigs...

00:26:47.079 --> 00:26:48.880
...seem to have run to the sacred fruit tree in the garden.

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:01.519
Little Black

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:03.519
Little Black

00:27:04.759 --> 00:27:05.400
Little Black

00:27:08.079 --> 00:27:08.599
Little Black

00:27:16.119 --> 00:27:16.480
You...

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.160
What are you doing?

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.160
Long time no see.

00:27:38.799 --> 00:27:40.480
I'm shaking hands with Little Black.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.559
Saying hello.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:45.799
I forgot to mention earlier.

00:27:46.799 --> 00:27:47.880
This is a portrait of Commander He.

00:27:49.359 --> 00:27:50.119
Give it to Yinglu.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:26.880
Forget it, forget it.

00:28:27.039 --> 00:28:27.759
Stop copying.

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.799
I'll have Keren copy it for me instead.

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:31.039
Quick, quick!

00:28:32.039 --> 00:28:33.519
Quickly, tell me about Commander He.

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:35.599
Miss

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.400
A'Lan wants to take care of Little Black.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.319
Aren't these four the same?

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.319
None of them are black.

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.440
Black, pink, white...

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.279
What's the difference?

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:54.200
Aren't they all pigs?

00:28:55.839 --> 00:28:56.319
A'Lan

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.279
It's said that Commander He...

00:28:58.559 --> 00:29:01.319
...had memorized all the martial arts manuals in the world by age three.

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.119
Is that true?

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:06.319
Thirteen years old.

00:29:09.039 --> 00:29:09.880
Then what about when he was eight,

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.319
and single-handedly wiped out a den of bandits?

00:29:12.079 --> 00:29:12.920
Miss...

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.680
That was a den of mountain rats.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.960
Are you sure what you know is true?

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.680
I never lie.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.440
Regardless of whether the rumors are true or false,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:26.960
I...

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.359
...will become like Commander He in the future.

00:29:29.799 --> 00:29:32.519
A peerless heroine of a generation.

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.119
Absolutely impossible.

00:29:37.039 --> 00:29:37.640
Brother!

00:29:39.039 --> 00:29:40.559
How can you have so little faith in your sister?

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.319
Why did you call me here?

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.640
I heard that today at the Shengxing Auction House,

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.559
there's a particularly grand auction.

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.480
Isn't your birthday coming up soon?

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:51.720
I want to go take a look.

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.200
To pick out a birthday gift for you.

00:29:56.799 --> 00:29:57.680
Brother...

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:04.880
Thank you, brother.

00:30:15.279 --> 00:30:16.240
Young Master

00:30:17.039 --> 00:30:20.640
Will others really not discover we are women?

00:30:21.759 --> 00:30:22.519
Of course not.

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:24.200
At first glance, you and I...

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.039
...are just two handsome young gentlemen.

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:27.960
You two young ladies!

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.640
We have all kinds of books here.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:30.640
Come take a look.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:39.519
What "young lady"?

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.759
I, your humble servant, am a genuine man.

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:43.759
Stop joking around.

00:30:44.039 --> 00:30:45.079
If we're talking about genuine goods,

00:30:45.319 --> 00:30:47.000
it has to be our martial arts manuals.

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:50.799
Take a look.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.079
Young lady.

00:30:58.559 --> 00:30:59.839
You might prefer these.

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.960
Young lady, let me interpret this fortune for you.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:09.839
Have a look.

00:31:11.559 --> 00:31:13.720
Great wealth and honor! You are blessed.

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:14.400
Thank you.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.039
Take care.

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.640
You, a script spirit, appearing openly on the street...

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:24.640
Is that appropriate?

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.359
Appropriateness is for this script spirit to decide.

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.440
Fortune teller.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.240
You've set it up quite convincingly.

00:31:34.599 --> 00:31:36.680
You're playing the maid quite convincingly too.

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:39.559
I heard you're now in charge,

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.359
responsible for the daily care of four little piglets.

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.279
Impressive, impressive.

00:31:45.559 --> 00:31:46.680
Don't be sarcastic.

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:47.759
It's all your fault.

00:31:48.359 --> 00:31:50.640
Who knows how long I'll have to be a pig-tending maid.

00:31:51.559 --> 00:31:52.960
Not for much longer.

00:31:53.559 --> 00:31:54.119
What do you mean?

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:55.240
Explain yourself clearly.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.359
Seeing how pitiful you are,

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:03.160
I'll kindly tell you.

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:07.079
Xiao Hei died on Meng Shaojue's birthday.

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:10.400
Alright.

00:32:10.799 --> 00:32:11.720
I've said all I needed to say.

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.480
Take care, I won't see you out.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.119
If you've said all you needed to, can't you say a bit more?

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:17.680
I'm telling you...

00:32:17.759 --> 00:32:18.240
A Lan.

00:32:19.319 --> 00:32:20.240
What are you doing here?

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.279
The auction is about to start.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:22.400
Let's go.

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:25.680
Young lady.

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:26.400
Fortune telling?

00:32:26.559 --> 00:32:27.200
Come, come.

00:32:27.319 --> 00:32:27.799
No, no.

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.440
Is A Lan still at your residence?

00:32:35.279 --> 00:32:35.880
Your Majesty,

00:32:36.559 --> 00:32:38.079
actually, A Lan she...

00:32:39.359 --> 00:32:39.799
Father.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.440
A Lan must find Seventh Cousin's residence fun,

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:43.720
and wants to stay a few more days.

00:32:45.839 --> 00:32:46.799
This child.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.519
Staying outside the palace all the time is improper.

00:32:50.119 --> 00:32:51.440
Your son will go to Seventh Cousin's residence

00:32:52.279 --> 00:32:53.039
and bring her back.

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:03.960
Please wait a moment, everyone.

00:33:04.079 --> 00:33:05.880
Today's auction items are all excellent.

00:33:06.279 --> 00:33:06.839
In a moment...

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:07.880
Young master.

00:33:08.319 --> 00:33:10.240
Disguising as a man is useless.

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:11.799
How is it useless?

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.960
Then why were you just discovered by the bookstall owner?

00:33:14.279 --> 00:33:15.839
That was just a minor accident.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:18.480
You two young ladies.

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:19.480
Please come inside.

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:27.359
Come.

00:33:29.799 --> 00:33:30.839
You two young ladies are in high spirits.

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.279
Coming to an auction dressed as men.

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:39.240
How did you discover we are women?

00:33:40.279 --> 00:33:41.400
Of course it's obvious.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.839
If wearing men's clothes and tying a topknot made one a man,

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.359
that would only happen in operas.

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.279
Right.

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:48.559
The disguise is revealed once the topknot comes loose.

00:33:48.839 --> 00:33:50.200
That would take us all for fools.

00:33:50.279 --> 00:33:51.000
Isn't that so?

00:33:56.759 --> 00:33:57.119
Little sister.

00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:57.920
Did you miss your brother?

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:58.400
Young master.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:33:59.960
Come, come, let me feed you a drink.

00:34:07.319 --> 00:34:09.280
This painting is also an item in this auction.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.280
Are you interested in this painting, young lady?

00:34:13.039 --> 00:34:13.920
That is one that I, Guan,

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.920
like the most.

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:18.760
Guan Yue.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:22.760
My lord.

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.400
This statue of the God of Wealth

00:34:24.519 --> 00:34:25.920
is the treasure of our shop.

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:27.159
What do you think?

00:34:34.039 --> 00:34:35.079
This won't do, this won't do.

00:34:36.039 --> 00:34:37.920
Your lordship's visit is this humble one's good fortune.

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:39.719
This God of Wealth statue,

00:34:40.079 --> 00:34:41.679
consider it a small token of my esteem.

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:43.559
One should not accept rewards without merit.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.360
Shopkeeper Li, you should still accept it.

00:34:48.039 --> 00:34:48.800
Thank you, my lord.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:49.559
You may withdraw for now.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.920
Please trouble yourself to deliver this statue to the Drunk Immortal Inn.

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:53.480
My lord, please look at other items.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:03.360
My lord.

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.760
Why hasn't Commander He arrived yet?

00:35:07.239 --> 00:35:07.760
It's me.

00:35:21.079 --> 00:35:22.159
The one who tricked me into going to the Cold Palace that day.

00:35:22.599 --> 00:35:23.800
The little eunuch whose face I didn't see clearly.

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.480
Finally found him.

00:35:25.119 --> 00:35:25.960
After questioning him for a bit,

00:35:26.079 --> 00:35:26.719
I lost track of time.

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.159
Which little eunuch is so bold?

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:30.519
It's Xiao Li.

00:35:31.079 --> 00:35:31.880
Xiao Li?

00:35:32.719 --> 00:35:34.519
That Xiao Li who serves the Fifth Princess?

00:35:36.239 --> 00:35:36.880
But him...

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.920
Why would he trick you, Commander He, into going to the Cold Palace?

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.079
And even throw you into a dry well?

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:43.960
That little eunuch said

00:35:44.639 --> 00:35:45.760
he once violated palace rules

00:35:46.079 --> 00:35:47.079
and was punished by me.

00:35:47.639 --> 00:35:50.000
So he wanted to take this chance to vent his resentment.

00:35:51.639 --> 00:35:53.679
But I don't remember such an incident.

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.199
I didn't expect the young lady to know me, Guan.

00:36:02.599 --> 00:36:04.559
I, Guan, have treasured this painting for many years.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:05.880
It's priceless, hard to obtain even with a thousand pieces of gold.

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.960
Today, I, Guan, am entrusting this painting

00:36:09.199 --> 00:36:11.079
to the Shengxing Auction House for the auction.

00:36:11.719 --> 00:36:12.519
Not for money.

00:36:13.079 --> 00:36:14.519
Only to find a kindred spirit.

00:36:15.239 --> 00:36:16.239
If you, young lady, like it,

00:36:16.679 --> 00:36:19.000
I, Guan, will withdraw this painting from the auction items.

00:36:19.599 --> 00:36:22.480
Part with it gladly and give the painting to you.

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.840
Since this painting is priceless,

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:27.960
you should keep it for the auction yourself.

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.119
If you feel uneasy about it,

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.280
how about I sell this painting to you?

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.239
I have no silver, I can't afford it.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:42.639
As the saying goes, a thousand pieces of gold can't buy a true friend.

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.440
This painting, in your presence,

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:50.119
is only worth the price of a meal.

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:51.719
Here.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:56.320
What's so good about this painting?

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.400
This painting is one I've searched for many years to find...

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:04.559
Darn it.

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:05.440
You!

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.119
I'll pay for it.

00:37:07.639 --> 00:37:09.119
Do you know how much this painting is worth?

00:37:09.639 --> 00:37:10.559
Can you even afford to pay for it?

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.800
This servant just heard

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.239
this painting is only worth a meal.

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.559
Miss, is this money

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:31.039
enough for a meal?

00:37:32.599 --> 00:37:33.519
It is naturally enough.

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:35.800
You...

00:37:42.679 --> 00:37:44.559
The first auction item today

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:48.199
is a jade thumb ring I've treasured for years.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:55.760
This ring is made of mutton-fat jade,

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.639
rich, smooth, and glossy,

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.079
lustrous, translucent, and pure.

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.239
It has absolutely no impurities.

00:38:01.719 --> 00:38:04.039
The starting bid is five hundred taels.

00:38:04.719 --> 00:38:05.360
Eight hundred taels.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:06.639
Eight hundred taels.

00:38:07.239 --> 00:38:07.719
One thousand taels.

00:38:07.719 --> 00:38:08.760
Good! One thousand taels.

00:38:09.679 --> 00:38:10.800
One thousand taels. Any higher bids?

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.280
Would my brother like this?

00:38:13.159 --> 00:38:14.440
Forget it. I'll buy it first and see.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:16.159
One thousand five hundred taels.

00:38:16.639 --> 00:38:18.480
Good! One thousand five hundred taels.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:20.840
Miss...

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:22.559
Do you have the silver?

00:38:23.039 --> 00:38:23.719
No, I don't.

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:26.320
But my brother does.

00:38:27.559 --> 00:38:29.760
Any bids higher than one thousand five hundred?

00:38:32.199 --> 00:38:33.000
Three thousand taels.

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:34.480
Good!

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.320
Young Master Guan, three thousand taels.

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.519
Bidding against him is such bad luck.

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:42.280
I'm out.

00:38:44.679 --> 00:38:45.760
Three thousand taels, going once.

00:38:46.559 --> 00:38:47.800
Three thousand taels, going twice.

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.960
Three thousand taels, going for the last time.

00:38:50.159 --> 00:38:51.840
Sold for three thousand taels!

00:38:54.599 --> 00:38:56.440
Let's congratulate Young Master Guan.

00:38:56.719 --> 00:38:59.800
For happily acquiring a jade thumb ring with three thousand taels.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.440
Miss, let's bid on something else.

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.239
Tearing up this young master's painting

00:39:15.159 --> 00:39:16.800
will come at a cost.

00:39:19.119 --> 00:39:20.559
How do you want to deal with this little eunuch?

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:23.599
According to palace rules,

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.360
he should be sent to the Disciplinary Office.

00:39:28.119 --> 00:39:30.320
That little eunuch... let him off the hook.

00:39:32.119 --> 00:39:34.199
Are you acquainted with this eunuch?

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:40.920
Since you've spoken up for him,

00:39:41.639 --> 00:39:43.280
I'll act as if this never happened.

00:39:44.199 --> 00:39:45.280
It's not like I have anything better to do anyway.

00:39:48.159 --> 00:39:48.880
Let's get to the main point.

00:39:50.079 --> 00:39:52.760
That night you infiltrated the Meng residence, did you find the map?

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:55.360
The Meng residence is heavily guarded.

00:39:56.159 --> 00:39:57.079
Finding that map

00:39:58.039 --> 00:39:59.159
is probably not that simple.

00:40:01.599 --> 00:40:03.480
So what's your next move?

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:05.880
Everyone, come look!

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:07.599
It's this maidservant!

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:08.920
She took my thumb ring!

00:40:10.719 --> 00:40:12.159
Young Master Guan's thumb ring is missing.

00:40:12.559 --> 00:40:13.880
Why are you so sure we took it?

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:16.639
It seems someone has lost something.

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:20.440
I didn't take your thing.

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:22.880
Hold on.

00:40:24.719 --> 00:40:26.360
You say you didn't take it, so that's it?

00:40:27.639 --> 00:40:29.559
I think Young Master Guan is deliberately seeking revenge,

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:31.000
framing and setting us up.

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:33.039
Whether it's a frame-up or not,

00:40:33.719 --> 00:40:35.000
we'll know after a search.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:41.880
Fifth Princess.
