Ji Li!

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.510
I only have you in my heart,

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.680
only you.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.400
You were in my illusion,

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.510
connected with my soul,

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.640
and shared my emotions.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.760

you will be alright.

Ji Li, Ji Li!

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.430
I saw her star dim

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.870
in Flowing Star;

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.120
I came to save her.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.940
Without immortal bones, she cannot live.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.960
Yet

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.960
there is one chance left.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.400
Bones can be re-forged,

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:02.940
and broken shards re-grown.

of an ancient divine beast.

In recent years,

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.430
no one has entered and lived.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.280

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.560

Ji Li,

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.960
are you unwilling to wake up?

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.870
Sorry, I should never have left you.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.080
Ji Li,

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:14.270
Jie Chuan

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.630

Ji Li!

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:01.270
You're awake.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:04.960
Where is Ji Li?

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.080
How is she?

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:07.790
She woke long ago.

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:12.710
Then where is she?

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:15.840
Oh, no.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.120
It's my loose tongue;

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.440
I mentioned the Grave Gorge.

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:20.200
She must have gone there.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:22.480
Grave Gorge...

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.440
Ji Li!

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:04.480
You're hurt.

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:06.510
Just a scratch;

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.510
don't worry about me.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.080
I brought you water from Flowing Star.

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:48.630
Drink a little.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.480
Right now, the immortals

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:53.440
hates the demons to the bone.

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:56.030
Plus, Jie Chuan broke his promise.

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:58.290
If they know about your two,

00:14:58.290 --> 00:14:59.910
exile will be the least
of your troubles.

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:01.550
That was only a misunderstanding.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.200
I must return and explain to Master;

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:06.200
perhaps

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.600
I can lessen the immortals' bias
against Jie Chuan.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.240
You're in trouble yourself;

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.150
why fret over him?

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.750
You should just go to the Demon Realm

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:15.300
and spare yourself this lovesick pain.

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:17.390
The great war began because of me;

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.960
I have to return.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.360
Yet I can't stop worrying about him.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.030
He suffered these wounds

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:25.270
for my sake.

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:26.590
(Ji Li)

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:28.030
(wants to return?)

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.550
(No. She must not leave.)

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:33.470
What's wrong?

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:39.080
Your wounds...

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.280
Wait.

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:43.050
Your power hasn't recovered.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:44.390
Let me check his injuries first;

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:45.460
then we'll think of a plan.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.440
Sure.

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.440
How can this be?

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.370
Cultivation backlash
for a Demon Sovereign?

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:56.960
What do we do?

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.080
I'll try again.

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:12.360
Ji Li, things are tricky now.

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:14.750
Why don't you stay here?

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.870
I'll fetch

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.240
Hong Zhua to treat him.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.440
Hold on.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.840
You won't see him for a while.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:24.680
I'll go.

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:25.790
Jie Chuan, hold on.

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:30.030
Am I that fragile?

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.390
I'll circulate for a while.

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:38.750
I feel lively; I'm fine.

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:43.360
You two are just happy

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.200
to endure each other.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.870
All right, I won't disturb you.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.630
As for what you asked,

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:50.240
I'll pass the word to Hong Zhua.

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:52.240
As for his illness,

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:54.440
as long as you stay,

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.580
