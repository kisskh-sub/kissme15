I'm skipping out tomorrow
for that tasting, you know.

everything is completely above board,

the caterers

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.320

Twice-Cooked Pork for Sichuan dishes?

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.940
The honey-glazed crispy pork looks good.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:48.080
Over there.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:49.640
Yum.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.460
We're here.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:58.940
Better food in the cafeteria

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.200
isn't all good news.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.400
Actually, come to think of it,

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:03.440
it's mostly bad.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:05.800
Let's hear it.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:06.780
First,

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:08.500
it's too crowded,

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.360
and the lines are forever.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:11.880
Second,

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.520
the food is so good

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:14.540
that I've been overdoing it

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:15.660
and now I'm gaining weight.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.440
But I remember

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.000
back when I first joined,

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.080
someone told me

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.060
bad food at the cafeteria makes you fat

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.300
because you binge later
to feel satisfied.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:29.060
Who?

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:30.540
Who would say

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:32.800
such nonsense?

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:35.520
A little puppy said that.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:37.000
Anyway,

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.220
you guys are quick.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.380
Already digging in.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:40.640
You didn't

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:41.940
sneak out of work early, did you?

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:43.340
Here,

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:45.020
have some juice
to get some vitamins into your system.

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.500
Hey, don't call us out like that.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:47.780
We only slipped away
a few minutes earlier.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:48.900
I'm so jealous.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.580
We've got two giants crushing us.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:52.900
We can't even move.

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.460
We're the ones who are jealous.

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:55.500
You get to enjoy eye candy

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.100
like Mr. Lin every day.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.520
What's there to envy?

00:11:58.620 --> 00:11:59.500
It's not like he belongs to us.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:00.860
Xiguang.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:04.800
Xiguang, a quick question.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.380
The food here is better now.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.320
So why have you been

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.400
eating out every night instead?

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:16.800
Eat up.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.940
The year-end party gifts

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.360
are coming in at 12:30 PM.

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.660
We need to go and check them in.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:22.380
Hurry up.

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:33.040
This one is great!

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:34.900
I want this one

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.580
and that one, too!

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.000
We have great taste.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:38.980
Everything's so practical.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:40.620
I don't really care about these.

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:42.440
I just want to win the paid leave.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:43.980
Who doesn't want that?

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:45.480
Cui Qin,

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:47.380
Mr. Zhang, Mr. Lin, and Procurement

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:48.980
have a meeting

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:49.540
at 3 PM.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:50.820
I need you to take the minutes.

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:52.180
Mr. Wang,

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:53.580
I have to go to the plant
this afternoon.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:54.960
I'm not sure when I'll be back.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:56.180
Mr. Wang,

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:57.820
I'll take care of it.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:12:58.980
Alright.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:12:59.760
Thanks.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.360
Nie can do it too.

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:05.260
Thank you.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:17.780
What's your point?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.040
So you're not dodging Mr. Lin anymore?

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:21.140
What are you talking about?

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:22.100
When did I ever dodge him?

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.160
Got any proof to back that up?

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.240
Due to external factors,

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.920
many of Procurement's suppliers

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.560
need to be re-vetted and re-engaged.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.400
Mr. Lin recently

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.380
provided us

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:37.520
with the company's

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:38.940
key raw material

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.200
[PV Glass Price Comparison]
external RFQ list in 2012.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.320
This helped us streamline

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.140
the supplier shortlist much faster.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.620
Then, based on

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:45.400
my past experience with the vendors

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.560
throughout our collaborations,

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.720
Procurement has drafted a preliminary

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.880
supplier assessment list.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.900
First, regarding photovoltaic glass,

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:53.380
our top recommendations

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.640
are these two manufacturers:

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.660
Qicai Glass and Mingyan Glass.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.460
From a pricing perspective,

00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.780
Qicai is about five percent

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.080
higher than Mingyan.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.360
However,
Qicai's quality control and capacity

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.020
are more stable.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:06.540
Furthermore, over the past few days,

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:07.560
I have been in contact with them.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:08.740
Technologically, they have

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:09.520
made another breakthrough,

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.960
and they have very warmly invited us

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:11.920
to conduct an on-site inspection.

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:12.880
Qicai Glass

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.040
is an old friend of ours.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:15.580
Their management team

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:17.680
truly prioritizes R&D innovation

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:18.800
and quality control.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.280
You should consider

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:21.420
flying there for a visit.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:22.660
We're on the same page.

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:23.760
I'm planning to go.

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.060
I've met Mr. Wu from Qicai

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.400
once before.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.200
I'll fly out this time as well.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.800
Let's try to finalize everything
in one trip.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.080
Wang Qi,

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:31.980
you're coming with me.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.620
What dates are we talking about?

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.480
There are a lot of meetings and events

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.120
before Chinese New Year.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.500
Mr. Zhang asked me to attend those.

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:41.660
I'm afraid

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:43.100
my schedule is already packed.

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.600
This inquiry list

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.740
from Administration

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:48.940
is quite comprehensive.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.460
I wonder who prepared it.

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:52.500
Actually, we should consider
bringing that person along.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:53.620
As for my team,

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:54.960
I'll be bringing Mr. Wang Xin.

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:57.000
I had Nie put together

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.720
this inquiry document.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.580
Wang Qi reminded me

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:03.800
that with the end of the year
approaching,

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:04.820
we need to check

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:05.720
the department's schedule.

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:07.940
It could just be the three of us.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.040
Why don't you coordinate

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:09.900
the schedule with them?

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:10.400
Sure.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.020
Then let's wrap up

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:15.780
today's meeting.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:16.760
Okay.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.020
Nie, wait.

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:31.200
Nie,

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:33.760
you looked

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:35.360
very distrustful.

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:37.960
Because

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:40.240
you have a bit of a track record.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:42.680
True.

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:45.240
But not this time.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.000
Because

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:48.800
I'm still caught in a dilemma.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.180
About what?

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:54.700
The approach.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:56.900
I believe

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:58.160
pursuing a girl

00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.220
should be upfront.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.120
But doing so in the office

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:03.000
will definitely get

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:03.800
people talking.

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:05.420
It wouldn't be fair to you.

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:13.520
You're overthinking it

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.340
a bit.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.200
That's just how the world works,

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.460
so I have to consider every detail.

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:24.300
But there is a way.

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:25.360
Nie,

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:26.820
why don't you stop

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:27.300
hiding your true identity?

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:29.200
Then, most of the talk

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:30.680
will be focused on me.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.140
And I can finally show you
what I'm made of.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:36.620
Mr. Lin,

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:37.980
Mr. Zhang asked me

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:39.480
to have you look over
this document first.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:44.340
Think about the business trip

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.180
and get back to me.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:53.940
A business trip.

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:58.460
I seriously can't help myself anymore.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.420
Xiguang, you're going with Mr. Lin?

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.500
Just the two of you?

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:02.760
Oh my goodness,

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:04.300
I knew there was something going on.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:05.800
Nie Xiguang,

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:07.060
if you don't admit

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:07.880
that Mr. Lin is pursuing you,

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:08.900
I'm so done with you.

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:19.880
You know,

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:22.960
I used to be

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.720
a very fearless person.

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:28.280
Back then, if I liked someone,

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.660
I'd go all in and pursue them.

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.760
I wasn't like this,

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:40.740

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:42.200
in charge of procurement?

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:44.620
Late last year,

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:45.700
during a HQ internal audit,

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:46.980
he was flagged

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:48.800
for financial irregularities
during his time there.

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:50.720
Later, they found out

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:52.880
his record at Shuangyuan
wasn't clean either.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.200
So...

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:57.360
I just didn't realize

00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:58.500
he had crossed you as well.

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:00.420
I'm going

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:01.280
to bring this up with my grandfather.

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:04.800
Why didn't you lead

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:05.860
with such a massive piece of good news

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:06.840
the moment we met?

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:09.000
Forget about telling your grandfather.

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:10.080
It's fine.

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:11.700
I'm not a petty man.

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:12.840
I only have one question.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:14.260
Is he behind bars?

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:16.660
Pretty much.

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:17.920
Sen,

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:18.880
you've only just arrived,

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.720
and you've already settled
an old score for me.

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.020
I'm

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:23.960
a big believer in fate and energy.

00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:25.800
Our signs must be perfectly aligned.

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:26.640
We really should

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.360
stay in close touch.

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:29.560
I'd be more than happy to.

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:30.780
I'm new to the industry,

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.220
so I have a lot to learn from you.

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:34.440
Of course.

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:36.860
We're in the same supply chain.

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:39.180
We rise and fall together.

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:40.340
To be honest,

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.140
my beef with Mo

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.720
isn't just

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.140
about a personal grudge.

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:46.700
The main thing is,

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:48.200
he cut ties with us

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:48.940

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.320

overpriced Japanese products instead.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.640
In fact, over the last few years,

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.300
the quality of domestic PV glass

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.480

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.920
There's really no need

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:21.400
It comes in these two colors.

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:22.900
Your friend is using

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.100
the exact same model.

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:26.820
Is it good?

00:34:27.719 --> 00:34:28.060
Yeah.

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:29.500
It's really snappy.

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:31.159
You could go with the pink one.

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:32.540
It makes a great set

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:33.520
with your friend's.

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:41.320
The color doesn't really matter.

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:42.960
I'll be using

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.120
all kinds of cases anyway.

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:45.719
So

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:46.620
pink is fine.

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:47.440
Sure.

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:50.900
And I'll take the one
with the most storage.

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:51.460
You got it.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
We actually have one last unit in stock.

00:34:54.139 --> 00:34:55.139
The total

00:34:55.139 --> 00:34:56.280
is 2498.

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:03.280
Who's paying?

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:03.780
I am.

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:07.960
Okay.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.140
Would you like me to unbox it?

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:13.440
We can help you set it up.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:14.500
That'd be great.

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.480
Could you help me

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:17.400
install the basic apps

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.400
and WeChat?

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:20.060
Miss,

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:21.620
since your old phone

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:22.780
is the same brand,

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:24.100
all your messages,

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:25.620
contacts, and photos

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.480
can be transferred

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:27.300
to your new one.

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:28.240
Okay.

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:29.500
Thanks.

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:36.560
Wait!

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:44.000
Actually, I only need

00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:44.840
the contacts.

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:46.220
Everything else

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:47.580
can just stay on the old phone.

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:48.640
Okay.

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:05.140
Yep, I'm all set.

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:06.780
Come on, let's add each other.

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:12.040
[New Friends: "Lin"]

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:12.780
[Profile of "Lin"]

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.700
Wow, you're fast.

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:21.820
I've been watching.

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:23.640
Since you've got the new app,

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:25.240
of course I have to
be the first to apply.

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:32.020
Do you accept?

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:36.900
I do.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:40.860
Request approved.

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:42.820
My friend.

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:53.300
Ms. Chen.

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:55.040
Brought you
some double-layer steamed milk custard.

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:56.280
Thanks.

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:57.620
Didn't you go to buy necessities?

00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:58.720
How'd you end up
hauling food back for me?

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:00.520
Honestly, I wasn't even hungry

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:01.440
until I spotted this place

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:02.200
that's famous for their milk custard.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:02.760
I gave it a try

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:03.960
and honestly, it's really tasty.

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:05.040
Mr. Lin also said...

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.640
He said he was worried
you might be on a diet,

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:16.560
so if you don't want to eat it,

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:17.540
I'll just hand it back to him.

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:18.920
No point letting it go to waste.

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:20.880
He's quite petty, isn't he?

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:21.740
Of course I'm having some.

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:23.080
It's delicious.

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:24.300
The milky flavor really comes through.

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:36.640
Nie,

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.680
are you and Mr. Lin...?

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:43.280
No, we're not.

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:44.640
We...

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.040
I mean, me and him...

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:48.940
Don't sweat it.

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:50.120
I was just asking out of curiosity.

00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:52.700
Nothing like that.

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.600
There are a few things

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:58.400
I probably shouldn't bring up,

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:01.080
but after

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:02.340
what I've been through,

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:04.720
I'd still like to give you a heads-up.

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.360
My old company

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:09.820
was considerably larger than Shuangyuan.

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:10.760
You've probably heard of it.

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:12.420
I joined right after graduation

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:13.440
and stayed over a decade,

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:15.360
rising to Deputy Chief of Procurement.

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.060
I thought I'd spend

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:17.940
my whole career there.

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:20.040
I've always been cautious

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:21.540
and held firm to my principles,

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:22.900
refusing to take dirty money,

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:24.600
and that made me a target

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:26.000
when I got in the way
of others' easy money.

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:27.780
Office politics and backstabbing

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:28.580
come with the territory,

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:31.340
but they went out of their way

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:32.760
to resort to the lowest tricks,

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:34.600
painting me as someone

00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:36.380
with a tangled love life.

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:38.300
All of a sudden,

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:40.320
stories about me

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:41.660
were spreading like wildfire.

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:44.040
They're disgusting.

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:46.220
So what did you do?

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.120
What could I do?

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:51.300
They whisper behind my back,

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.440
and put on an act in front of me.

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:54.560
You're right.

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:56.380
They're disgusting.

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:00.020
I wanted to call the police,
but there's no evidence.

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:01.780
I tried talking to the boss,

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.260
but he just brushed it off,

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:04.720
saying I was overthinking it.

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:09.700
That was the last straw.

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:11.460
I just walked away.

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:14.600
I'm not wasting any more energy
on those scumbags.

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:16.840
Of course,

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:18.360
before I left,

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:20.760
I left them a little parting gift.

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:24.520
Well done.

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:29.140
But isn't this just a way
of running away?

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:31.140
And didn't they

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.080
actually win?

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:35.320
It's truly tough for us women

00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:37.240
in the workplace.

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:39.960
We work our heads off,

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:40.900
and no matter how well we do,

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:42.720
others can just

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:43.500
throw together some rumors

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:45.380
and drag you through the mud.

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:47.120
Nie,

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.200
I've learned the hard way.

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:51.620
That's why I want to warn you.

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:53.400
Maybe ask Mr. Lin

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:54.540
to keep a lower profile?

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:56.220
Otherwise,

00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:57.300
I'm afraid the backlash

00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:58.100
will all be aimed at you.

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.220
With the way he's been acting,

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:02.140
even for someone whose romantic radar

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.020
is as rusty as mine,

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:03.820
it's pretty obvious.

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:06.240
So you can bet the others
have noticed too.

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:07.840
But don't worry.

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:10.000
My lips are sealed.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.000
Ms. Chen,

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:17.720
Thanks for telling me this.

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:19.960
We've actually

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.020
thought about it,

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:24.560
but we decided

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:25.860
to just let things take their course.

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.240
After all, there's no rule

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:29.620
against workplace dating,

00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:31.440
so we decided

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:32.520
there's no need to hide it.

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:34.440
Actually,

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:36.640
I went through

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:38.340
something similar

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:39.060
back in college.

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:40.380
It wasn't as severe

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:41.260
as what you faced,

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:42.820
but...

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:44.960
that feeling

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:47.640
of being wrongly accused

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:50.160
and having no way to explain yourself

00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:52.140
is the same.

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:55.520
And

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:57.380
even long after,

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.720
it still haunts you out of nowhere,

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:01.960
making you

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:03.920
humiliated

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:06.420
and wronged.

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:10.660
It's like living under a shadow.

00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:20.820
That's why I'll do everything I can

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:22.880
to make sure nothing like this

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:24.120
ever happens to you,

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.420
or anyone else in this company,
ever again.

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:29.840
Look at you,

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:33.040
talking like you're my boss

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:34.960
and you're here to protect me.

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:40.960
No, that's not it.

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.320
It's just back then,

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:46.880
I wished someone
would have protected me.

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.700
I did have friends who helped

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:51.440
and comforted me.

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:52.960
So I just...

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:53.840
I get it.

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:56.100
I mean, you might not be my boss,

00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:58.780
but listening to you,

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:01.520
I somehow feel a sense

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:03.620
of security.

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:05.180
Alright.

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:07.440
Since you and Mr. Lin

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:08.660
have already thought this through,

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:10.660
I'll keep my mouth shut.

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:11.880
I just hope you don't think

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:13.060
I'm being nosy.

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:14.400
Not at all.

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.300
I feel quite comforted.

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:17.960
The milk custard

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:18.800
was totally worth it.

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:22.720
Alright, it's getting late.

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:23.200
Go

00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:23.940
take a shower and get some sleep.

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:31.640
Wait, Ms. Chen.

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:33.060
I think you misunderstood.

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:34.160
Mr. Lin and I

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.520
aren't in a relationship yet.

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:36.900
"Yet"?

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:42.980
Got it.

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:47.820
Just call me Chen.

00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:48.760
Everyone in the department

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:49.460
calls me that.

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.000
