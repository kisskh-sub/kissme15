00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.560
You're quite the God of War.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.400
It would be a waste not to turn you

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.350
into my puppet.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.930
Ji Li is Jie Chuan.

Ji Li is Jie Chuan.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.350
Ji Li is Jie Chuan.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.870
Ji Li is Jie Chuan.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.480
Ji Li is Jie Chuan.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.190
Ji Li has already been slain by Jie Chuan.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.400
Don't tell me you're really going to

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.560
take revenge.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.000
Jie Chuan,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.190
pay for taking my disciple Ji Li's life.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.240
Master.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:06.750
Jie Chuan,

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.400
you took Ji Li's life

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.400
and even used her body to grow flowers.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.590
With Ji Li gone,

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.030
your spirit must be shattered.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.240
Today,

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.470
I will end you.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.080
So her soul may find peace.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.960
Master.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.360
What are you talking about?

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.430
Master, what are you trying to do?

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.920
Master.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.500
Master.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.240
Master, it's me, Ji Li, wake up!

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.240
Master.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.280
Master...

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.590
Ji Li.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.360
Master.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.360
Jie Chuan.

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:01.470
Jie Chuan,

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.640
let her go.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.310
You used such a vile scheme,

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.430
trying to drive a wedge
between me and Ji Li.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.560
To end you,

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.600
I don't need a scheme.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.740
(Hunling City)

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.100
(Hot Spring Pavilion)

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.750
Who… who are these people?

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.350
No idea.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.120
What's going on?

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.630
What's the situation?

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.680
This place is…

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.870
It should be my Demonic Ether

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.720
clashing with that fellow's power

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.160
that shattered the barrier.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:02.800
That's how we came here.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.120
We came here by irregular means.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:12.950
Art is restricted here.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.680
My power flickers on and off.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.830
For the time being,

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:18.560
we're not able to go back.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.600
So for now, you...

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:22.870
Does that mean

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.270
you've called a truce?

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.070
Stay here and wait for a bit.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.800
I'll take a look around.

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:58.040
Why should we follow his orders?

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.120
We're going too.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.200
Ji Li.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:05.720
Just stay put and don't worry.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.000
Is everything ready yet?

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.270
Lady Serpent Immortal is waiting.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:19.560
Serpent Immortal.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.270
You two, come over here.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.920
A mere mortal.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:27.830
How dare you summon me like a servant.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.430
We're in the Mortal Realm.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.520
Art is restricted.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:36.160
We must act with caution.

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:38.950
Didn't you hear me speaking to you?

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.680
Lady Serpent chooses Ji Ling for tribute.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.190
Are you ready?

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.870
What on earth are you wearing?

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.270
You look so flamboyant.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.800
And are those two horns on your head?

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.270
This one is perfect.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.800
What a rare beauty in the Hunling City!

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.360
How did I never notice before?

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:12.920
Lady Serpent Immortal

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.120
favors ones like you.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.480
A delicate scholar with a gentle frame.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.720
Miss, please mind yourself.

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:19.310
Guards.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.360
Present him to Lady Serpent Immortal.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.360
Willing or not, you must comply.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.270
Take him away.

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:35.510
Master.

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:37.390
Master.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:38.960
Master.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.040
Ji Li.

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:42.870
Are you just going to watch

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.030
my master being taken away?

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:47.120
Do not act recklessly.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.000
Our powers are restricted in Hunling City.

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:53.360
Ji Li.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:55.840
My master...

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:58.630
Hong Zhua won't die just yet.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.320
Besides,

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.000
they're just mortals.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.510
If they all managed to kill him,

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.960
he wouldn't be worthy of being my rival.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.960
Your spiritual power is weak

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.910
and your wound hasn't healed yet.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.790
Let's find a place to settle down.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:13.720
But this is Hunling City.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.390
It costs money to settle down.

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:16.510
What should we do?

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.870
I am the lord of the Demon Realm.

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:20.320
For a thousand years,

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:21.510
I have reigned supreme,

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.390
revered by the common folk.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.560
Besides,

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:25.960
I have countless temples.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:27.150
We'd find a place to stay.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:29.750
Let's go.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.460
Hurry, over here.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:36.510
There's lodging here.

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:52.220
(Hong Zhua Temple)

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.870
We've searched over a dozen temples.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:00.390
All of them belong to my master.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.630
Hunling City has stood for millennium,

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:04.630
witnessing changes.

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.840
No wonder people don't recognize you.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:07.920
Silence.

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:15.150
Your Grace,

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:16.550
don't bother with the ignorant folk.

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:18.720
At least they left us food.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.550
I'd never eat Hong Zhua's offerings.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:25.870
The wound...

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.260
(Hong Zhua Temple)

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.510
You're badly injured

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:03.670
and you've absorbed my Demonic Ether.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.480
Two different powers clashing together

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.600
will force your true form to reveal.

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:18.960
Take some med for now to suppress it.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.720
Once I return to the Demon Realm,

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.320
I'll find another way for you.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:37.870
Don't overthink it.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.150
I saved you

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:41.870
because the Demon Realm
needs spirit plants.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.720
You keep saying you want to kill me,

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.240
yet you always end up saving me.

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:51.910
Your Grace,

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.080
you're approachable

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.240
and strikingly handsome,

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.060
nothing like
what the Immortal Clan describes,

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:56.910
cold, unfeeling,

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:57.910
bloodthirsty by nature.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.160
Go on.

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:06.390
What other rumors

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:07.720
they have been spread?

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.270
I only…

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:11.840
heard it in passing.

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.320
Word is, Your Grace,

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:18.550
you were outplayed
by the Demon‑subduing Immortal.

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:20.320
Back during the great war,

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:22.870
he defeated you
with a single move

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:24.770
and you couldn't recover for centuries.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.120
Rumor—this must be pure rumor.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.000
I believe…

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.360
you're surely the greatest under heaven.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.280
Foolish fish.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:36.750
It is that

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.720
I've simply indulged you too much.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.630
You mustn't let pride turn to anger.

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:43.200
That's not how a gentleman behaves.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:45.720
Gentleman...

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.910
In your eyes,

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:55.000
haven't I always

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:56.910
been a great villain,

00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:59.480
a swindler, have I?

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.270
I only called you that in secret.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.510
Oh, you did in secret?

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:28.630
What is this?

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.080
These are fireworks.

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:34.110
Fireworks?

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.610
The Temple Fair in Hunling City.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.630
Temple Fair.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.510
Tonight, I'm in high spirits.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.080
I order you

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:46.670
to join me for a stroll.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.670
(Tough words, soft heart.)

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.200
(Perfect chance to ask about
Master's whereabouts.)

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:58.000
Wait for me, Your Grace.

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.780
(Tea House)

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:30.370
Sir,

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.320
have you seen a tall man

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:33.720
with peach blossom eyes

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:34.750
and fair skin?

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:36.080
No, I haven't.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.080
Thanks.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.870
I order you to join the Temple Fair,

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.360
not to hunt for Hong Zhua.

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:45.630
The Temple Fair

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:46.750
costs money.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:47.630
How will we enjoy it?

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.510
Have the offerings at Hong Zhua Temple
grown dull to you?

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:55.510
Come on.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:59.790
So close.

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:00.630
Sir.

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:01.510
What is it?

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:02.910
I heard in Hunling City,

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.670
if you hit ten out of ten

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:05.840
in the pitch-pot game,

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.600
you'll win one string of coins.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.440
Is that right?

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:10.080
Ten out of ten, you say?

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.200
If you land all ten today,

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:15.270
besides the string of coins...

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.320
See those items over there?

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:18.910
Pick one as you wish.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.240
Hasn't your power yet to fully recover?

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:24.910
Mortal trinkets.

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:26.870
I have no need to use power for this.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.480
Well done.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.030
- Perfect.
- Nice.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.430
- Another hit.
- Indeed.

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:08.820
He must be quite the master.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.600
- Impressive.
- Remarkably impressive.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.320
Please halt, sir.

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.440
You already hit eight.

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:20.720
Do you truly believe you'll hit all ten?

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.550
Just grab a small prize and be done.

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:25.390
Petty mortal pest.

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:27.110
Sir,

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.220
step aside a bit.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.080
What is a pest?

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:56.290
