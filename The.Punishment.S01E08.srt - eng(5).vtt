00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.360
Could Scar and his people

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.290
have confessed?

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.350
No way.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.440
Scar has worked for me for many years

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.700
and been through a lot.

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:10.840
He's tighter-lipped than anyone.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.250
People are unpredictable.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.970
You can't fully trust them.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:17.980
Cut that crap.

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:20.480
You would've got in trouble already

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.880
if I hadn't reminded you.

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:23.630
It was you who raised the idea

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:25.150
and engaged Qian Yuhong in this.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:27.100
The mistake must be on your side.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:28.330
Mr. Luo, calm down.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.830
The root cause

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.030
of this predicament

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:32.960
is Qin Feng—such a pain in the neck.

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.150
Weren't those establishments

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:37.150
of yours shut down

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:39.250
by Qin Feng not long ago, Mr. Luo?

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.890
I've cleaned up my own mess,

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.100
while yours is yet to be dealt with.

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:45.870
Mr. Luo, at this time,

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:48.550
it's pointless to hurl insults
at each other.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:50.550
The priority is to solve the problem.

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:51.080
We've

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.550
suffered financial losses,

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.480
but Qin Feng hasn't found any evidence.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.360
So, I think

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:56.330
all is fine.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.120
Tell Qian Yuhong to turn herself in.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.390
That's not necessary at the moment, is it?

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:00.960
It takes time to prepare witnesses,

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.820
evidence and testimonies in advance.
Understood?

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:04.600
Or how do you say

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.510
we should put an end to this whole thing?

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:07.080
Enough.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:10.810
They haven't traced to us now,

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.070
but it doesn't mean they won't forever.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:14.440
We must

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.170
extricate ourselves soon.

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:17.600
We can't

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:21.110
let the police find anyone
beyond Qian Yuhong.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.150
Rest assured, Mr. Ma.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.550
I've done proper preparation beforehand.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.520
Bole Finance

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:28.720
is by no means legally

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.180
associated with the online gaming company.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:32.700
Hao,

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.720
I know you are

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.790
somewhat into Qian Yuhong.

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:38.250
But I'm warning you,

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.390
don't let your affection for a woman

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:43.250
obstruct our great cause.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.760
In this regard, Luo truly outperforms you.

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:46.240
Yes.

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:47.750
You're right, Mr. Ma.

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:48.960
It was I who founded

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.080
the online gaming company for the group.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.080
It's very secure.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.240
Once things quiet down,

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.740
I can start over anytime.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.400
I do appreciate that perspective of yours.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:00.970
Luo Bo,

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.080
you should really

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.870
learn from Hao about certain things.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:04.510
Got it?

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:05.000
Mr. Ma,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.270
I'm very much flattered.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.360
I've just read a few more books
than others.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.230
Mr. Luo has more

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:11.560
practical experience than I do.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.200
I should learn from him in this respect.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.200
No, no, no.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.350
Mr. Song is tremendously...

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:17.480
knowledgeable.

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:19.840
You're just being modest, Mr. Luo.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:20.750
Take

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:22.120
Larry Page

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.490
and Steve Jobs as examples.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:26.480
They both dropped out
to start their businesses

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.390
and became outstanding entrepreneurs
in the end, right?

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:30.870
You're just like them, Mr. Ma.

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:32.870
Heroes could come from all origins.

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:35.100
Well said.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.300
Very well said.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.400
Keep up the good work.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:41.760
The future depends on you young people.

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:43.320
Mr. Ma,

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:45.040
I'll take my leave then.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.860
I will meet with Yuhong

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:47.620
and give her

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.050
proper instructions.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:50.630
Okay.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:01.390
Later on,

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.260
have your people

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.100
keep an eye on Qian Yuhong.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.600
You need to protect yourself from danger.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.310
Got it?

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.200
Got it.

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:13.020
What about Ye Tianyou's nephew?

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:14.390
Rest assured. He's been on the hook.

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:16.720
We just need to pull the fishing rod
at the right time.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.840
I'm also sourcing a kidney

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.100
for Wang Tao's mother.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.840
When one is found,

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:24.400
I don't believe he'll reject it
and watch his mother die.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.240
Remember,

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.050
the more you know about your rival,

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.700
the higher your chances of winning.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.000
Got it.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:57.840
Tianye,

00:12:58.840 --> 00:12:59.550
I heard

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:02.330
the police raided
the Rainbow Network Company.

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:03.480
But Yuhong

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.210
and Song Hao weren't affected.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.550
I believe
Qin Feng will bring them to justice.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:09.200
But we can't sit back and do nothing.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.130
We must help him.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:10.840
But Feng said...

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.600
Listen to me.

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:13.600
You just stay with Luo Bo

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:16.070
and keep close watch
on Song Hao and Yuhong.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:18.080
Yes.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.240
What do you think?

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:28.510
I think it's nice.

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:29.910
The ventilation's good.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.670
More importantly,
sunlight can get through,

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:32.000
right?

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.730
Uncle and you can bask in the sun

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:34.840
in the living room or the balcony.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:35.440
That's cozy,

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:35.970
isn't it?

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:38.960
Siyuan, this will be your room.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.000
There's even a place for me?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.390
The apartment also comes with a study.

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:42.990
-Auntie, then I...
-Siyuan!

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.960
Mr. Song.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.600
Why are you still calling me Mr. Song?

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.240
Didn't I tell you

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.040
to call me Hao?

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:52.760
Sure. Hao.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:53.790
What are you doing here?

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:54.990
Addressing an issue.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.250
Who's this lady?

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:57.870
Allow me to introduce

00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:58.670
my aunt to you.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.150
This is Song Hao,

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:01.360
an enterpreneur.

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:02.450
Let's sit and talk.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:02.840
Well,

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.120
do you...

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.550
also own

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:07.200
this development?

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:07.790
No.

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:09.030
This project belongs to Jinding.

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:10.690
My company has invested in it.

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.790
I have to say

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.200
these apartments are really nice.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:14.510
I agree.

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:15.370
Right, Auntie?

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:16.720
Look,

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.640
my aunt is thinking about

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:19.670
buying an apartment

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:21.510
for better living conditions.

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:22.510
You see,

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:23.570
my uncle is about to

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:24.480
retire.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:26.430
The two of them would like

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:28.680
a comfortable abode for their old age.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.730
But the problem is...

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:34.390
The price is a bit too high.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.250
That's easy to fix.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.600
I'm friends with the sales manager.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:40.480
Ma'am,

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:41.720
with my help,

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.400
you'll get a 30% discount if you put down

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:45.890
a deposit today.

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.420
Auntie, what do you think?

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:48.510
Siyuan,

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:50.870
that 30% discount

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:52.080
will save me much money.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:52.550
Indeed.

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:54.360
How about...

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.750
you pay a deposit now?

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.370
Maybe

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.770
I should discuss it with your uncle first.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.260
Laugh at me if you want.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.870
To be frank, your uncle

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:07.530
manages all family finances.

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:09.440
I understand.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:10.440
Uncle lives

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:11.630
a frugal life.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:14.810
He disdains the idea of squandering money.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:15.440
I get it.

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:17.730
As for the deposit,

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:18.820
I'll handle it.

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:22.440
How can I trouble you with that?

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.040
I'm just doing what I should.

No, I haven't.

there must be weak spots.

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:23.470
Officer,

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:25.030
I'd like to reiterate

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:27.080
that I've never heard about
this network company

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.410
you just mentioned.

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:29.020
Also,

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:30.790
I don't know any of the people

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:31.960
you asked me about.

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:33.790
If you have any evidence,

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:34.680
arrest me right now.

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:35.480
If not...

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.460
let me go, as I'm very busy these days.

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:43.290
Do you have any other question?

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:02.720
This is odd.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.480
I could tell
she was about to confess just now.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.410
Why suddenly...

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.620
Find out her parents' address.

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:20.160
Qian Yuhong

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.750
was just brought
to the Public Security Bureau.

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:22.590
Qin Feng

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:23.850
nearly broke her down.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.200
This woman

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:27.230
must be eliminated soon.

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:28.880
Got it.

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:30.200
I'm sorry, sir,

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:31.840
for causing you trouble.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.920
The two of you, go catch

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.440
Qian Yuhong's father and brother.

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:41.240
What's wrong, Bo?

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.070
Do as I say!

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:43.270
Yes!

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:48.590
Call Song Hao.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.260
Have him come over.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.210
Yes, Mr. Luo.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.160
Let go of me!

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:06.470
What is this for?

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.480
Hands off!

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:08.350
Move it!

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:08.960
Let me go!

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.000
Let go of my son!

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:11.340
Let go of my son!

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:12.400
Let go of my son!

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:14.480
Let go of me!

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:15.110
Hands off my son!

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.720
Freeze!

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:16.940
Leave my son alone!

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:17.550
Let me go!

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:18.410
Let go of my son!

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.670
Stay down!

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.070
Don't move!

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:27.730
Let go of me!

00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:30.750
We're police. Don't be afraid.

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:32.810
You're Qian Yuhong's family, right?

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:55.790
Mr. Ma,

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:56.960
what happened?

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.020
What did Yuhong do?

00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:59.810
She planned to flee

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:02.790
After she made a deposit with a bank,

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:05.070
Qin Feng took her
to the Public Security Bureau.

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:06.200
She nearly confessed.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.350
That's impossible.
Why would she try to flee?

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:09.150
I'll call her.

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:25.990
I took every precaution,

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.350
including sending people to her home.

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:31.200
But her family were taken away
by Qin Feng in the end.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.150
Now, her entire family

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:33.810
has completely disappeared.

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:37.690
If Qian Yuhong
wasn't cooperating with the police,

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:40.180
why would the police protect her family?

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:44.310
Mr. Ma,

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:46.790
could it be a misunderstanding?

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:48.920
Everyone should clean up his own mess.

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.560
Qian Yuhong is your aide.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:51.750
Mr. Ma,

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:54.350
things haven't gotten this serious, right?

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:56.590
Besides, the police
are keeping close watch on us.

00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:57.920
If anything goes wrong,

00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:59.970
you'll be implicated, won't you?

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:00.630
Is that so?

00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:13.080
You're still reluctant
to make a real effort.

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:14.110
Mr. Ma.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:15.510
Mr. Ma.

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:17.400
You take care of this matter

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.730
regarding Qian Yuhong.

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:22.750
Where is Qian Yuhong?

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:23.480
I don't know.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:25.670
Lin,

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:27.020
He says he doesn't know.

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:29.200
What do you mean?

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:50.730
I'll ask you one more time.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.360
Where is Qian Yuhong?

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:54.020
Guanlan Residence.

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:55.150
Mr. Ma,

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:56.940
I'll talk to her.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.060
I promise she'll keep her mouth shut!

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:01.200
Lin, go with him.

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:35.110
Dad.

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:36.310
Yuhong,

00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:37.290
where are you?

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:40.160
I'm home. What's wrong?

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:40.950
Have you

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.660
got in any trouble lately?

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:43.870
This afternoon,

00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:45.240
some people came to our home

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.040
and nearly

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:47.610
kidnapped your brother.

00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:48.310
Fortunately,

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:50.110
two officers came to our rescue.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.480
You're saying
two police officers came to your rescue?

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.280
That's right.

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:57.580
They were Officer Qin and Officer Wang.

00:30:58.670 --> 00:30:59.320
We're

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:01.150
with them right now.

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.400
Oh, right. Yuhong, wait a second.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.510
Officer Qin wants a word with you.

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:06.760
Officer Qin.

00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:11.170
Qian Yuhong,

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.090
where are my family?

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:16.220
They're at the police station now,

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.260
safe and sound.

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.770
Don't worry about them.

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:20.830
Thank you, Officer Qin.

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:21.760
You're welcome.

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:23.710
I'm only fulfilling my duty.

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:26.330
Please leave me alone, Officer Qin.

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:29.400
I really can't afford to cross those guys.

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:31.540
Qian Yuhong,

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:33.820
I'll say this to you again.

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:37.000
Even if you take the fall for them,

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:39.810
they still won't let you off the hook.

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:40.990
In other words,

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:43.720
though I've brought your family here
today,

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.160
there's no way they can

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.160
stay in the police station forever.

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:49.260
You get that, don't you?

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:51.200
But what if I tell you

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.110
their claws have reached you?

00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:55.280
What do you mean?

00:31:57.510 --> 00:31:59.830
Previously, in the Public Security Bureau,

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:01.350
the officer seated next to you

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:02.210
could be a mole.

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:03.510
He wore a bracelet

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.260
that was a gift from me.

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:09.100
Who do you mean?

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.410
I'm sorry, Officer Qin.

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:12.960
I don't want to go to prison.

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:19.000
Anything wrong?

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:19.970
What did she say?

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:25.590
Nothing much.

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:38.250
I'll go make a report

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:39.920
to the captain.

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.240
Take them...

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:43.930
to the bureau later.

00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:46.610
Officer Wang,

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:48.960
is Yuhong in trouble or what?

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:50.120
Mr. Qian, take it easy.

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:52.120
The matter is under investigation.

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:57.990
[Incoming call: Luo Bo]

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:00.600
Chief Zhang, I need to take this call.

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:01.920
Okay. Go ahead.

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:17.280
What do you want?

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:18.350
Tao,

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:22.340
I've waited a long time
for a call from you.

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:25.450
I heard
you guys took Yuhong's family away.

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:26.810
That was quick.

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:28.700
Stop harassing me.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:29.240
Listen,

00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:30.670
you won't get away this time.

00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:32.200
That had better not happen.

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.170
Should I get in trouble,

00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:36.740
how can your mother
receive a kidney transplant?

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.300
I've found a kidney for her.

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:40.280
Will you take it?

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:44.810
Hand over Qian Yuhong's family

00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:45.690
to me,

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:48.740
and I'll arrange a surgery
for your mother right away.

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:51.000
A suitable kidney is really hard to find.

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:53.680
Give some serious thought to my offer.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.250
Eyes on the road.

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:19.030
Try some peanuts.

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.889
They're tasty.

00:34:19.989 --> 00:34:20.830
Let me try.

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:21.570
Me too.

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:22.909
Don't grab them all. Save me some!

00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:23.969
Sure. Here you are.

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.530
Thank you so much, Peng.

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:27.670
Without your help,

00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:28.600
we couldn't have

00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:29.980
secured a warehouse and a car.

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:31.550
We're partners now.

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:32.880
Why mention that at all?

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:34.400
I only did what I should.

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:35.590
What did you say?

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:36.320
I only did what I should.

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:37.400
We can't take your help for granted.

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.510
Thanks should be given when due,

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:39.030
right?

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:40.770
You're welcome.

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:41.550
Try one.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:44.230
Cheer up. Put on a smile.

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:45.760
How rigid of you.

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:53.280
Nice peanuts.

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.260
Delicious.

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:55.510
Tianye,

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:56.280
bad news.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.480
Qian Yuhong has fled.

00:34:57.590 --> 00:34:59.320
Luo Bo sent Song Hao to find her.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:00.640
Where are you?

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.470
Guanlan Residence, North Zhongshan Road.

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:03.270
Come here now!

00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.880
Tianfei.

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:09.760
What's wrong?

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:14.460
Jiangyong,

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:15.920
can you drive to Guanlan Residence,

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.180
North Zhongshan Road?

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:20.150
Tianye,

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.440
are you hiding something from us?

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.330
What is it with you? Say something!

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:47.610
Why are you all here?

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:48.590
Tianye,

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:50.880
they know the truth now?

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.810
Why didn't you discuss this with us first?

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:55.700
Involving Fei in this

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.210
is putting him in danger!

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:58.780
It's fine. I'm not afraid.

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:00.770
My acting was pretty good, wasn't it?

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:01.670
Jiangyong, you...

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:02.480
even hit me.

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:04.130
Cut it out.

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.480
I have no choice now.

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:08.830
Since we're on the same boat,

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:11.090
I might as well be honest with you.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:12.860
Stop being mad.

00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:17.310
What's the situation now?

00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:20.070
Look at that place with the light on.

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.710
Song Hao has been up there for a while.

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:23.720
I guess

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:24.940
Yuhong is in there.

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:26.360
But this is strange.

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.320
What are they doing

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.230
in this undelivered residential project?

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:29.840
Tianye,

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.170
how about...

00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:33.670
giving a call to Feng?

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:38.010
Not after an observation.

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:55.100
I don't think she's been here.

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:05.500
Does she have any other dwelling place?

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:08.440
She has several more properties
in Hanzhou.

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:10.170
We'll check them out one by one.

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:40.000
Tianye,

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.220
shall we go after them?

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:45.090
Let's go up and take a look.

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:54.150
It's empty.

00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:56.850
What a waste of effort.

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:06.290
Isn't this a wild goose chase?

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:28.880
What was that about?

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:29.880
You startled me!

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:37.000
Is this authentic or fake?

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:49.280
What's in this box?

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:54.640
It's so heavy.

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:57.860
