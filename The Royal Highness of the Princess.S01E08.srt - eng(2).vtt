00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.280
I think Young Master Guan is deliberately seeking revenge.

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:46.719
Framing and false accusation.

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:49.120
Is it a frame-up?

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.959
We'll know if we search.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.879
You say I'm framing her?

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:11.960
Look.

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.199
This is the physical evidence.

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.039
Why not send this maid to the Magistrate's Office?

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:22.599
Who dares?

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:26.080
I think you secretly put it in there.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.759
Why is the Fifth Princess here?

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:29.599
My lord.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.599
Do you plan to stand by and do nothing?

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.280
Or play the hero saving the beauty?

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.400
It seems the incident at the Drunken Immortal Tavern last time...

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.360
...didn't teach Young Master Guan a lesson.

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:43.360
Meng Shaojue.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.520
She's caught red-handed.

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.759
What's wrong with sending her to the Magistrate's Office?

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:49.039
Brother.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.599
It's this Guan fellow slandering A Lan.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.680
So she's from your Meng Mansion.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.319
You wouldn't be trying to shield this maid, would you?

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:00.560
Did you see her steal your thumb ring with your own eyes?

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.360
Of course.

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:03.599
My thumb ring...

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:05.400
...was found in this maid's basket.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.800
If not her...

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:07.800
...then who else could it be?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.120
Yes, who else could it be?

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.800
Right.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.599
It must be her.

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:12.599
She's caught red-handed.

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.159
My thumb ring is worth three thousand taels.

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:17.159
According to our Yunmi Law...

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.599
...this maid should be punished with facial branding.

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:23.199
Young Master.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.000
Your servant did not steal anything.

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:36.800
The box contained Young Master's incense.

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:38.639
How could there be a thumb ring?

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.319
This incense was specially made for me by Yuxinzhai.

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:52.400
Once it touches something...

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:54.919
...the hand will definitely retain its scent.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.560
Confess now...

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:05.719
...and you can avoid some physical suffering.

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:09.039
Young Master Meng.

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:11.039
It was him.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.280
He gave me the thumb ring.

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:13.479
He told me to secretly put it...

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:14.639
...into that girl's bamboo basket.

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:16.439
Spare me, Young Master Meng!

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.560
Who told you to take matters into your own hands and slander others?

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.439
You've really overstepped.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.040
I...

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:26.639
That day at the Drunken Immortal Tavern...

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.079
...I was merciful and let you off.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.480
Yet you push your luck.

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:31.199
You...

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:31.839
Young Master.

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:32.199
How dare you!

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:33.360
No, no, no!

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.720
What wouldn't I dare?

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.040
Young Master.

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:38.879
Young Master, are you alright?

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:39.680
Don't worry.

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:41.160
I won't die.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.160
Young Master.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.720
Let's go.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.120
Young Master Meng.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.360
Young Master Meng, what skillful methods.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.439
My lord has seen quite a show.

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:12.079
If my lord has no further business...

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.360
Grand Preceptor Meng...

00:05:14.079 --> 00:05:16.360
...previously presented a little black pig to the Fifth Princess.

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:17.959
Yesterday, the Fifth Princess...

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:19.680
...specifically asked me to thank Young Master Meng.

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:22.839
She said she would return the little black pig to the Meng Mansion in a couple of days.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.040
If the Fifth Princess likes it...

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.839
...she may keep it by her side.

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:29.040
When I see the Fifth Princess later...

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.040
...I will personally convey Young Master Meng's kind intentions.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.920
See me?

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.120
Yuwen Rui wants me to go find him.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.199
Let's go.

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:54.040
Brother.

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:57.439
Do you think the Fifth Princess will discover...

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:59.600
...the little black pig given to her is actually a little spotted pig?

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.480
If she discovers it, so be it.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.040
His Majesty won't blame us for such a trivial matter.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.040
Come to think of it...

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.160
...this Lord Yuwen is also pitiable.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.160
To be betrothed to a vicious, unreasonable...

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.439
...and inhumane Fifth Princess.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.040
You have nothing better to do...

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:15.959
...than to pity Yuwen Rui?

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:17.720
Brother.

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:19.279
I accidentally overheard before...

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:21.040
...Father and Imperial Physician Chen from the palace talking.

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:23.120
They said Lord He and Lord Yuwen...

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.600
...fell into the water while chasing an assassin.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.279
The Fifth Princess actually jumped in, trying to save Lord Yuwen.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.040
I guess...

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:29.839
...this Fifth Princess...

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:31.480
...must have taken a fancy to Lord Yuwen.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.439
Miss.

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:35.240
Lord He is so good.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.399
Why didn't the Fifth Princess save Lord He?

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.000
You also think Lord He is good?

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.759
You have good taste, you silly girl.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.920
If Lord He and Lord Yuwen...

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.000
...both fell into the water...

00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:49.480
...I would definitely save Lord He first.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.680
Your servant would also save Lord He.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.000
Lord Yuwen always wears a stern face.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.000
It's unsettling just to look at him.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.040
Your servant doesn't like him either.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:05.759
My lord.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.079
What did the Fifth Princess mean by her words just now?

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:09.759
Could it be...

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:11.680
...that night, the one she wanted to save...

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:14.040
...was Commander He, not you, my lord?

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:16.839
But why would she do that?

00:07:18.399 --> 00:07:18.959
My lord.

00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:20.920
She couldn't have fallen for Commander He, could she?

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.360
So that means...

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.319
...the next day, when she came to our mansion...

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:27.639
...it was to see Commander He.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.360
The miraculous medicine was also prepared for Commander He.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.120
Say one more word...

00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:37.759
...and you'll be heading to the Northern Territories tomorrow.

00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:52.720
Why would the Fifth Princess go to the Meng Mansion?

00:08:02.519 --> 00:08:03.120
What's wrong?

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:06.800
Nothing.

00:08:09.839 --> 00:08:12.920
Did you have any previous interactions with the Fifth Princess?

00:08:15.319 --> 00:08:16.560
The Fifth Princess and I...

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.199
...have none.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.919
I will find a way to get the map from the Meng Mansion.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:35.960
Don't worry.

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:38.639
Be careful in everything.

00:08:41.879 --> 00:08:43.159
Regarding the Fifth Princess being at the Meng Mansion...

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.840
...don't leak it out for now.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:46.919
Understood.

00:08:48.279 --> 00:08:48.919
That Guan fellow...

00:08:48.919 --> 00:08:50.960
...if he dares to throw his weight around in front of you again...

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:51.960
...just tell me.

00:08:52.879 --> 00:08:53.679
Don't worry.

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:55.120
With your brother here...

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.799
...I'd like to see who dares bully me.

00:08:58.799 --> 00:08:59.480
I have other matters.

00:08:59.919 --> 00:09:00.840
You return to the mansion first.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.159
Maybe I should go find Yuwen Rui.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:09.720
Miss.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.639
Your servant left something behind.

00:09:11.639 --> 00:09:12.480
I'll be right back.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:14.679
You...

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:15.080
Two thousand taels.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:15.879
Good, two thousand taels.

00:09:15.879 --> 00:09:16.519
Three thousand taels.

00:09:16.799 --> 00:09:17.399
Three thousand taels.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.919
Do you know which room Lord Yuwen is in?

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.879
This dagger is extraordinary.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.480
Is there any bid higher than three thousand?

00:09:24.679 --> 00:09:25.120
Come on.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.120
Three thousand taels, going once.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.960
That boy Shuncai still hasn't been found.

00:09:29.759 --> 00:09:31.120
He truly is ungrateful.

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:32.360
Brother treated him well.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.360
Yet he stole Brother's dagger.

00:09:35.039 --> 00:09:36.200
That was the last birthday gift...

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.960
Mother gave to Brother before she passed.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.120
This dagger is very important to Meng Shaojue.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.919
He shouldn't be reluctant to pay for it.

00:09:42.919 --> 00:09:44.000
Three thousand taels, going twice.

00:09:44.279 --> 00:09:45.679
Three thousand taels, last call.

00:09:45.679 --> 00:09:46.320
Five thousand taels.

00:09:47.039 --> 00:09:47.600
Excellent.

00:09:47.799 --> 00:09:48.919
The young lady bids five thousand taels.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.960
Is there any bid higher than five thousand?

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.440
Here we go, five thousand taels, going once.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.360
Five thousand and one taels.

00:09:58.879 --> 00:10:00.720
What does Yuwen Rui want with this dagger?

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.080
Six thousand taels.

00:10:03.679 --> 00:10:05.480
The young lady bids six thousand taels.

00:10:05.639 --> 00:10:06.799
Six thousand and one taels.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.360
He's deliberately opposing me.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.559
Seven thousand taels.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:12.480
Good.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.000
Seven thousand taels! Seven thousand!

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.240
Seven thousand and one taels.

00:10:15.679 --> 00:10:16.159
Very well.

00:10:16.159 --> 00:10:17.039
The young master upstairs...

00:10:17.039 --> 00:10:18.639
bids seven thousand and one taels.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.440
Ten thousand taels.

00:10:20.559 --> 00:10:21.960
The young lady bids ten thousand taels.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:22.519
Now then.

00:10:22.519 --> 00:10:23.480
Ten thousand taels, going once.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.279
What thing could be worth ten thousand taels?

00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:26.440
Ten thousand taels.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.360
Ten thousand and one taels.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.960
The young master upstairs bids ten thousand and one taels.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:32.759
Alright.

00:10:32.759 --> 00:10:33.759
Ten thousand and one taels, going once.

00:10:34.399 --> 00:10:36.000
Ten thousand and one taels, going twice.

00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:38.399
Ten thousand and one taels, last call.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.279
Here we go.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.120
Sold!

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.960
Let's congratulate the young master upstairs.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.840
Sold for ten thousand and one taels.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.519
My lord, the dagger is yours.

00:11:16.279 --> 00:11:17.120
Fifth Princess.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.279
Eldest Cousin.

00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:25.639
How did the Fifth Princess become a maid at the Meng Mansion?

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.360
It's fun.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:29.720
The world is dangerous.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.200
It would be best if the Princess returned to the palace soon.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:36.519
My lord.

00:11:36.879 --> 00:11:38.399
She couldn't have fallen for Commander He, could she?

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:48.600
A Lan.

00:11:49.679 --> 00:11:50.360
A Lan.

00:11:51.879 --> 00:11:53.039
For saving my life at Luo Street River...

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:54.559
I haven't properly thanked the Fifth Princess yet.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:55.519
Today, I shall...

00:11:55.519 --> 00:11:55.960
Commander He.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.559
Help me lure the people below away.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.080
A Lan! A Lan!

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.120
Where has this girl run off to again?

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.120
A Lan.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.559
She's truly worrisome.

00:12:25.639 --> 00:12:26.440
A Lan.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:29.879
A Lan.

00:12:32.679 --> 00:12:33.519
You, stop right there!

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.200
You!

00:12:38.039 --> 00:12:38.559
A Lan.

00:12:40.559 --> 00:12:41.320
A Lan.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:51.360
A Lan.

00:12:54.519 --> 00:12:55.440
Put me down right now!

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.720
Put me down!

00:12:57.679 --> 00:12:58.840
Hurry up and put me down!

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.519
What is it, my lord?

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.279
You are dismissed for now.

00:13:10.399 --> 00:13:10.919
Dismissed.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.240
The auction just now...

00:13:24.559 --> 00:13:25.720
What exactly did you mean by that, my lord?

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:27.440
Since I was already here...

00:13:28.039 --> 00:13:29.080
I had to bid on something.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.200
What exactly did you want to see me for, my lord?

00:13:35.639 --> 00:13:36.480
I need to hurry back.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.919
The Fifth Princess isn't worried about Xiao Lizi at all?

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.200
Xiao Lizi?

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.080
What's wrong with him?

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.639
The Fifth Princess probably doesn't know...

00:13:49.399 --> 00:13:51.080
Xiao Lizi has confessed to everything.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.559
What are you talking about, my lord?

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.919
I don't understand any of it.

00:13:57.519 --> 00:13:58.879
What did Xiao Lizi confess to?

00:14:01.279 --> 00:14:02.960
On the day we pursued the assassin at Flying Immortal Pavilion...

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.080
Commander He was tricked into going to the Cold Palace.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.159
And was drugged.

00:14:06.399 --> 00:14:07.840
He was hidden in the dry well of the Cold Palace.

00:14:08.679 --> 00:14:10.360
The Fifth Princess knows nothing about this.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.120
Why would Xiao Lizi do such a thing?

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.080
I always felt someone was behind Xiao Lizi.

00:14:22.879 --> 00:14:24.759
But this little eunuch's lips are sealed tight.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.480
He won't say a word.

00:14:30.879 --> 00:14:31.720
Once I return to the palace...

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:32.799
I'll discipline him immediately.

00:14:35.039 --> 00:14:36.000
The Fifth Princess is kind-hearted.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.759
Allow me to handle this matter for you.

00:14:38.639 --> 00:14:39.840
My lord, you are swamped with state affairs.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.000
I wouldn't want to trouble you.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:41.879
It's no trouble.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.519
I am willing to serve the Fifth Princess.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:49.840
Speak, my lord.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.639
What will it take for you to let Xiao Lizi go?

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.159
If I let him go...

00:14:55.759 --> 00:14:56.600
What's in it for me?

00:14:59.519 --> 00:15:01.639
The only thing I can do for you now...

00:15:02.559 --> 00:15:04.440
seems to be just one thing.

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.279
Didn't I promise before...

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.840
to cancel our marriage arrangement?

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.279
I've been too busy lately and forgot.

00:15:14.279 --> 00:15:14.919
Don't worry.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.799
If you just let Xiao Lizi go...

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:17.759
Once I return to the palace...

00:15:17.759 --> 00:15:19.000
I'll immediately find a way to cancel it.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:19.919
How about it?

00:15:21.159 --> 00:15:21.879
Not good enough.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:24.879
Let go of me!

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:26.039
Let go of me!

00:15:26.039 --> 00:15:26.879
Put me down!

00:15:27.559 --> 00:15:28.159
You petty thief!

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.919
Dressing like Commander He, you...

00:15:30.639 --> 00:15:31.600
Put me down!

00:15:33.879 --> 00:15:34.879
Just you wait, I'll teach you a lesson!

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.200
Aren't you going to let me go?

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:46.519
You...

00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:51.759
Miss Meng.

00:15:52.559 --> 00:15:53.480
I, He, am in the wrong.

00:15:53.879 --> 00:15:55.440
Take this silver as my apology.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.039
You, stop right there!

00:16:02.759 --> 00:16:04.039
About calling off the engagement...

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.240
No hurry.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.080
Then what do you want?

00:16:09.399 --> 00:16:10.159
How about...

00:16:11.559 --> 00:16:13.679
You find something for me in the Meng Mansion.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:16.799
Find what?

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.559
The Map of the Nine Provinces.

00:16:21.639 --> 00:16:22.919
So the map is indeed in the Meng Mansion.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.159
This is a fake map.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.440
After you find the real one,

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:32.919
use it to replace this.

00:16:40.879 --> 00:16:41.759
Every day at evening,

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.679
report your progress to me at Xizi Lake.

00:16:53.559 --> 00:16:54.279
What is it?

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.799
You've seemed troubled the whole way.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.080
Actually, A Lan she...

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:04.279
Rufeng.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:06.680
Young Master Xiu.

00:17:06.799 --> 00:17:07.559
Fourth Princess.

00:17:09.559 --> 00:17:10.559
The thing I asked Brother to find...

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:13.119
Did you get it back?

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.000
It... it should be back, right?

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.359
What do you mean 'should'?

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.079
Brother is inside.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:24.880
I'll go ask him.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:25.920
A Zi.

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:27.119
Let's go see Brother first.

00:17:27.759 --> 00:17:28.359
Young Master Xiu.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:29.279
Fourth Princess.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.119
Young Master Xiu.

00:17:35.119 --> 00:17:36.400
What exactly do you want with our lord?

00:17:37.119 --> 00:17:38.759
Don't you know why I'm looking for him?

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.240
Is this the room?

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:46.359
This...

00:17:48.519 --> 00:17:49.079
Brother.

00:17:49.839 --> 00:17:50.400
Brother.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:51.640
The thing I asked you to find...

00:17:56.759 --> 00:17:57.680
There's someone else in the room.

00:18:00.799 --> 00:18:02.839
Could it be you're hiding a beauty?

00:18:02.839 --> 00:18:03.839
Don't you want your thing back?

00:18:04.759 --> 00:18:05.599
You got it back, didn't you?

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:14.559
This milk tea is quite good.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.920
A Zi, you should try some too.

00:18:16.839 --> 00:18:17.720
You have something on your mouth.

00:18:24.759 --> 00:18:27.079
What is this thing you asked Big Cousin to find?

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.240
Why are your ears red?

00:18:36.079 --> 00:18:37.480
It's probably too hot.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.799
What exactly is this thing you're looking for?

00:18:43.519 --> 00:18:45.440
Just an antique.

00:18:46.039 --> 00:18:47.480
I asked Brother to find it for me.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.160
I think the items on display at the auction house are nice.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:56.759
Let's call A Lan over later.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.640
See if there's anything she likes.

00:19:03.039 --> 00:19:03.720
Let's go.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.559
A Lan is alone in your mansion.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.000
I'm worried.

00:19:15.319 --> 00:19:16.039
Wait a moment, wait.

00:19:17.559 --> 00:19:19.759
Why is this wine so strong?

00:19:21.319 --> 00:19:22.559
I'm feeling a bit drunk.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:25.559
Seventh Cousin.

00:19:26.319 --> 00:19:27.880
You didn't drink just now.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:31.799
That's right.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.640
Could it be there's wine mixed in this milk tea?

00:19:37.039 --> 00:19:38.759
H-how is it so intoxicating?

00:19:44.799 --> 00:19:45.519
Let's go.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:48.400
No, no.

00:19:48.799 --> 00:19:49.680
I'm still a bit dizzy.

00:19:50.559 --> 00:19:51.319
I need to lie down for a bit.

00:19:51.319 --> 00:19:52.079
Wait.

00:19:55.079 --> 00:19:55.839
What is it?

00:20:01.319 --> 00:20:02.039
I need to rest too.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:03.559
You go to the room next door.

00:20:04.799 --> 00:20:05.519
Brother.

00:20:06.119 --> 00:20:08.039
This bed is quite big.

00:20:08.799 --> 00:20:10.319
We brothers can sleep together.

00:20:27.359 --> 00:20:28.519
Brother, you...

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.000
These clothes...

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:32.920
These boots...

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.039
They clearly belong to a young gentleman.

00:20:36.039 --> 00:20:37.039
Brother, you actually...

00:20:42.799 --> 00:20:43.440
Brother.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.039
I'll just take a peek to see who it is.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:49.960
He's shy.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:50.720
He doesn't want to be seen.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.319
Brother.

00:20:57.799 --> 00:20:59.799
No wonder you usually keep your distance from women.

00:21:00.799 --> 00:21:01.960
So that's how it is.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.880
Oh, so that's it.

00:21:04.559 --> 00:21:06.440
Big Cousin meeting dancers at night is one thing,

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.920
but now you're secretly hiding a man?

00:21:12.799 --> 00:21:13.559
When I return to the palace,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:14.960
I will definitely have Father Emperor...

00:21:15.119 --> 00:21:16.680
reconsider your marriage to A Lan.

00:21:22.759 --> 00:21:24.960
Seventh Cousin, you're sober?

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:27.880
I got a bit of a fright.

00:21:28.799 --> 00:21:29.680
So I sobered up.

00:21:31.119 --> 00:21:31.759
Let's go.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.319
Let's go to your mansion to see A Lan.

00:21:36.799 --> 00:21:38.240
Brother, what do we do?

00:21:41.599 --> 00:21:42.319
Brother.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:43.960
Seventh Cousin.

00:21:49.319 --> 00:21:50.799
You're acting very strange today.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.079
A Lan, she...

00:21:55.559 --> 00:21:56.720
She's not in any trouble, is she?

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.519
Actually, A Lan she...

00:22:03.119 --> 00:22:03.880
The Fifth Princess...

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.119
is not at Zixiu's mansion.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.160
She's staying at my villa in the suburbs.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:12.920
At your villa?

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.039
No.

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.799
I'll go bring her back to the palace right now.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.559
I've hired a divine physician.

00:22:22.799 --> 00:22:24.319
He's currently treating her dementia.

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.400
No one is to disturb them for the next two days.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:27.799
Right, right, right.

00:22:28.319 --> 00:22:30.519
A Lan is receiving treatment at Brother's villa.

00:22:32.519 --> 00:22:33.279
Really?

00:22:33.759 --> 00:22:34.720
I might lie,

00:22:35.039 --> 00:22:36.240
but Brother never tells lies.

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:42.640
Then this matter...

00:22:43.519 --> 00:22:44.720
Why didn't you tell Father Emperor?

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.799
I wanted to wait until the Fifth Princess fully recovers

00:22:48.559 --> 00:22:49.680
before telling His Majesty.

00:22:50.279 --> 00:22:51.039
Exactly, exactly.

00:22:51.319 --> 00:22:52.240
What if she can't be cured?

00:22:52.319 --> 00:22:53.960
Wouldn't that just give His Majesty false hope?

00:22:58.079 --> 00:22:59.440
Then I'll go see her in a couple of days.

00:23:00.799 --> 00:23:01.480
Let's go.

00:23:05.039 --> 00:23:05.799
Brother.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.680
I'm counting on you for that thing.

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:15.799
They're gone.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.039
Why are you still hiding?

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:18.680
Are they really gone?

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.000
Let me take a look.

00:23:31.599 --> 00:23:32.759
Why are you closing the window?

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.359
Clothes.

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.039
If I replace the map in the Meng Mansion,

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.640
will you, my lord, let Xiao Lizi go?

00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.400
Put your shoes and socks on.

00:24:03.359 --> 00:24:04.279
Let's discuss business first.

00:24:05.279 --> 00:24:06.440
Does the Fifth Princess not know

00:24:06.759 --> 00:24:07.799
that if a man sees a woman's bare feet,

00:24:08.039 --> 00:24:09.359
he must marry her?

00:24:15.759 --> 00:24:16.519
Pedantic.

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:17.759
My lord saw it.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.160
Surely you don't intend to marry me now?

00:24:24.599 --> 00:24:25.240
My lord.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.839
About Xiao Lizi...

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.160
You can't go back on your word.

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:32.200
Wait.

00:24:36.559 --> 00:24:37.839
There's something I need to confirm.

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:40.440
Please, my lord, speak.

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:43.759
Jumping into Luo Street River...

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.319
Was it really to save me?

00:24:50.079 --> 00:24:51.839
Why do you ask, my lord?

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.839
Because it could also have been to save Commander He.

00:24:59.279 --> 00:25:02.400
You heard what I said to Miss Meng.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.079
Back then, everyone mistakenly thought...

00:25:07.319 --> 00:25:09.400
I jumped in to save you.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:10.759
I couldn't defend myself.

00:25:11.039 --> 00:25:12.319
You are magnanimous, my lord.

00:25:12.799 --> 00:25:13.359
No.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.759
I never let anything slide.

00:25:20.079 --> 00:25:21.720
You didn't lose anything either.

00:25:22.319 --> 00:25:25.000
This little thing doesn't count as a grudge, right?

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:32.759
Why save Commander He?

00:25:35.039 --> 00:25:36.960
Commander He is loyal and courageous.

00:25:37.559 --> 00:25:39.359
He fought the assassin to the death.

00:25:39.599 --> 00:25:41.240
He risked his life to save the people.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.039
When such a brave warrior, devoted to his country and people, fell in...

00:25:45.319 --> 00:25:46.720
And I happened to be a good swimmer...

00:25:47.359 --> 00:25:49.039
How could I stand by and watch him die?

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:50.720
Is that all?

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:58.480
Remember.

00:25:58.799 --> 00:26:00.960
Report your progress on finding the map to me daily at evening.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.880
That dagger worth ten thousand and one taels...

00:26:13.759 --> 00:26:14.480
You don't need to take it.

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:15.559
My lord...

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.559
But that's ten thousand and one taels!

00:26:23.359 --> 00:26:24.000
Later.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.759
I really don't know what my lord is thinking.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.519
This ten-thousand-and-one-tael dagger...

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.920
He just says he doesn't want it.

00:26:42.759 --> 00:26:44.440
Who knows who'll get it for cheap now.

00:27:00.359 --> 00:27:02.720
I wonder where He Lianchen took her.

00:27:07.079 --> 00:27:07.519
He...

00:27:07.839 --> 00:27:08.559
Stop right there!

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:10.119
Miss.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:20.599
Young Master.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.160
The managers of all the major pawnshops...

00:27:22.359 --> 00:27:23.680
All say they haven't seen that dagger.

00:27:46.519 --> 00:27:47.400
It's Miss A Lan.

00:27:55.799 --> 00:27:57.200
I heard from Guard Xu...

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.519
Yesterday at the Drunken Immortal Tavern, if he hadn't gone back to save you...

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.000
The Young Master would have caught Shuncai and gotten the dagger back.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:06.720
When you get down to it...

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:07.799
It's still Yuwen Rui's fault.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.400
If it weren't for him...

00:28:09.599 --> 00:28:11.400
Would I need to be here looking for a dagger?

00:28:19.359 --> 00:28:20.519
She seems to be looking for something.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.480
Don't let me see you again!

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.960
Not at the Prosperous Auction House.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.559
And not back at the mansion.

00:29:14.599 --> 00:29:16.079
Where could A Lan have gone?

00:29:16.599 --> 00:29:17.680
And Brother is nowhere to be seen either.

00:29:22.519 --> 00:29:23.680
Rare to see you waiting for me at the gate.

00:29:24.079 --> 00:29:24.480
Brother!

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:25.559
Quick, come with me to report to the authorities.

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:26.759
I can't find A Lan anywhere.

00:29:26.759 --> 00:29:27.720
She must be lost.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.119
Don't worry.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.519
She's not lost.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.640
But she's so dim-witted.

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:33.720
Miss!

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.160
You dummy!

00:29:37.319 --> 00:29:38.359
Where did you run off to?

00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:42.960
What's with this outfit?

00:29:43.319 --> 00:29:45.039
Weren't you wearing men's clothes when you left?

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:47.599
Got lost.

00:29:49.079 --> 00:29:50.079
Fell in the water.

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.599
Bought new clothes.

00:29:52.599 --> 00:29:53.839
Money's all gone.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.119
What a mess of a story.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.519
How did you even fall in the water?

00:30:00.079 --> 00:30:01.240
Can't remember.

00:30:03.039 --> 00:30:04.680
What can that head of yours remember?

00:30:05.279 --> 00:30:06.839
From now on, don't wander off when you go out.

00:30:07.039 --> 00:30:07.839
Understood?

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:10.599
Oh, Miss...

00:30:11.559 --> 00:30:13.039
A Lan picked this up.

00:30:15.759 --> 00:30:16.680
Found it.

00:30:18.759 --> 00:30:19.640
Brother, look!

00:30:26.079 --> 00:30:27.000
Where did you find it?

00:30:31.039 --> 00:30:32.160
Can't remember.

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:33.960
Then how did you come to find it?

00:30:36.359 --> 00:30:37.319
Forgot.

00:30:38.759 --> 00:30:39.960
Forget it, forget it. Never mind.

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.680
You've done a great service.

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:44.400
I'll take you out for something delicious.

00:30:45.119 --> 00:30:45.640
Miss...

00:30:45.839 --> 00:30:47.240
A Lan wants to eat grapes.

00:30:47.599 --> 00:30:48.440
Fine, fine.

00:30:48.599 --> 00:30:49.480
You can eat whatever you want.

00:30:50.839 --> 00:30:51.799
I'm in a bad mood.

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.000
Keep me company for a good meal.

00:30:53.559 --> 00:30:54.559
What's wrong, Miss?

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.480
Ran into a petty thief.

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:02.640
You have no idea...

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.440
That scoundrel surnamed He...

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:05.720
Left this and ran off.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:07.559
Despicable.

00:31:07.799 --> 00:31:08.799
Did he hurt you?

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.079
He wouldn't dare!

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.359
I've already given the order.

00:31:12.759 --> 00:31:14.759
To find everyone in the city surnamed He.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.480
When I find him...

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.559
I'll have him sliced to pieces!

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:35.240
Miss...

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:36.559
Do you think...

00:31:36.839 --> 00:31:40.400
Petty Thief He looks like Lord He?

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.160
Aren't they similar?

00:31:57.799 --> 00:31:58.680
Similar? Not at all!

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.440
I'd recognize Lord He even if he were ashes.

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.440
That little thief has shifty, beady eyes.

00:32:04.599 --> 00:32:05.319
How could he compare to...

00:32:05.319 --> 00:32:07.680
Lord He with his sword-like brows and starry eyes?

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:12.519
Miss...

00:32:12.799 --> 00:32:14.720
He left silver to apologize.

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:15.880
He's a good person.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.160
Do I lack his paltry silver?

00:32:19.599 --> 00:32:21.839
Then maybe he had urgent business.

00:32:22.359 --> 00:32:24.039
I don't care what urgent business he had!

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.960
But you weren't hurt, Miss.

00:32:28.079 --> 00:32:30.519
But I was insulted!

00:32:56.599 --> 00:32:58.440
From now on, you'll serve in my room.

00:33:01.359 --> 00:33:01.960
Young Master.

00:33:02.599 --> 00:33:04.480
Your servant belongs in Miss's room.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:06.440
That's right, Brother.

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.680
Why are you trying to take A Lan from me?

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.160
I just find this girl amusing, that's all.

00:33:11.119 --> 00:33:12.079
That's still not acceptable.

00:33:13.359 --> 00:33:14.160
If, on my birthday,

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.519
I invite Lord He over,

00:33:16.519 --> 00:33:17.160
A Lan.

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.599
You'll go to my brother's place today.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.680
What? You're unwilling?

00:33:24.759 --> 00:33:25.559
Young Master.

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.920
Your servant prefers serving the young miss.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.359
The servants in our mansion need proper management.

00:33:34.079 --> 00:33:35.000
For instance,

00:33:35.359 --> 00:33:38.240
some don't rise until the sun is high,

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.839
some never do any work,

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:44.799
and there are others

00:33:45.359 --> 00:33:49.200
who eat more meat and grapes than their masters.

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:52.160
Young Master.

00:33:53.519 --> 00:33:55.519
Since your servant is going to your room,

00:33:56.119 --> 00:33:58.119
can I become one of those "some people"?

00:33:58.920 --> 00:33:59.720
Of course you can.
