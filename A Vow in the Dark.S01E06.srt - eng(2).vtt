00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.390
Such a shame.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.640
So close.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.000
Turns out he's a fraud.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.710
No wonder it wouldn't go in.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.150
Looks like this iron butterfly likes you.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.150
Can't be pried off.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.120
Everyone, watch closely.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.430
He is cheating.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.480
Wait, wait.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:34.770
Forget it.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.750
The whoe thing is a scam.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.240
Just wait and see.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.230
You won, it's yours.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.790
This is what I earned.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.400
Waiter.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.710
Two bowls of Plain Noodles.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.870
Hold on.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:55.760
Skip the Plain Noodles.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.840
Make it two bowls of

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.070
smelly bamboo shoot noodles.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.280
- Got it.
- Smelly...

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.000
bamboo shoot noodles?

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.310
Mm.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.120
What we usually have
are elixirs and delicacies.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.310
But now we're in Hunling City.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.520
We should try something bold.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.750
You've been here before?

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.800
Mm.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.430
Immortals and demons are constantly
at war.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.500
My spiritual power is weak.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.280
So I often sneak out in secret.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.080
Honored guests,

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.750
smelly bamboo shoot noodles is ready.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.080
Thank you.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.920
Please enjoy it.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.000
Such foul-smelling stuff.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.150
You're not eating it?

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.360
Then I will.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.120
You Immortal Clan folk

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.400
rarely have tastes like yours.s

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.560
Little rascal, still eating noodles.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.590
You ruined my plan.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.340
You…

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.680
I spared you just now.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.030
Yet you didn't value it.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.840
Then I'll make you suffer a bit.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.470
Come on, then.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.680
This is my own Heaven Formation.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.560
Today, I'll let you witness it.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.080
You're done now, huh?

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.800
Sorry, Your Grace. I'm counting on you.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.640
Not your business.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.390
(His power hasn't recovered.)

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.710
(But he should be fine, right?)

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.310
Run?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.840
Hand over the money.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.710
I…

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.920
Go…

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.630
- Monster!
- Monster!

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.310
Monster!

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.240
It's a monster!

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.800
No…

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.640
I'm not…

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.630
I'm not a monster.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:03.860
I'm not a monster.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.400
Strike her down! Strike her down!

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.470
I'm not a monster.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.680
I'm not a monster.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.990
Monster!

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.750
Strike her down!

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:15.840
Get lost!

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.960
Hit her!

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.800
- Strike her down!
- Burn her!

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.600
You troublesome succubus, a true jinx.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.530
Some spiritual plants in my manor
aren't planted yet.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.800
I won't let you suffer any harm again.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.520
Run, quickly!

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.880
Stop right there.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.110
Where are you going?

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:48.350
Your Grace,

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.480
I'm taking a stroll.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.270
You left me alone back there.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.070
Yet you ran off in a flash.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.390
Are you afraid

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:56.240
I'd settle scores?

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.160
No, it's not that.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.750
It's just the people in Hunling City

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.070
could never be your match, Your Grace.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.310
I was only worried that

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.510
I'd slow you down in a fight.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:12.130
With the scales,

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.390
you can't go anywhere unnoticed.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.480
You're eternal and indestructible.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:19.800
Power beyond measure.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.860
I'm just an Immortal Beast,

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:22.720
wounded and weary.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.000
Unlike you, I can't recover instantly.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.480
I don't want others to see me like this.

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.070
Even an Immortal Beast has pride.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.270
I don't think

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:32.270
you look bad.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.160
I just feel

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.120
it's a bit conspicuous.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.510
Since I was the one who took you out,

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.040
I would never

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.120
hold it against you.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.680
If those scales on you

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.760
trouble you,

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.600
I have a way to resolve it.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:52.710
Really?

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.770
Yes.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:54.710
I mean it.

What's going on here?

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.870
I don't need your healing.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:13.870
Your Grace,

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:15.750
you won't let me use Taijing Power.

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:17.510
Afraid you'd fall under my control?

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:20.950
You're overthinking it.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.830
Is that so?

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.830
Your hand is injured.

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:27.070
Are you sure you don't need my aid?

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.550
I require no assistance from you.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.720
Since you already know about it,

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:36.480
you'd better stay put as I say.

00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:37.550
Did you hear me?

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:42.630
(So now,)

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:45.200
(have I completely restrained Jie Chuan?)

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.080
(Then I can push him
into saving Master.)

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:52.360
Ji Li.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:55.790
If you dare activate it,

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.790
I will turn you back into a mere fish.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.460
(Serpent Immortal Temple, Hunling City)

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.960
My power still hasn't recovered.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.390
Sir,

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.150
you haven't had anything today.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:10.750
Have you thought it through?

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.000
As long as you serve Lady Serpent well,

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.960
you could even gain immortality,

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:18.150
let alone glory and wealth.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.280
Absurd.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.510
Living in shameless excess,

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.080
yet seeking immortality?

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.550
This hand of yours...

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:30.080
Fair and delicate.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.480
Lady Serpent will surely be pleased.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.910
This pretty face.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:39.720
Remember this,

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:42.200
use that newly made splendid robe.

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:43.350
Yes.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.670
Such a slender waist.

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:48.270
Don't forget the jade belt.

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:49.110
Yes.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.120
This graceful waistline.

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:56.630
Enough!

00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.790
You're overstepping now.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.270
Not yielding, are you?

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:02.350
Guards!

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:11.000
I have plenty of ways to deal with you.

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.870
Your Grace,

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:37.750
please.

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:42.200
You're being overly attentive.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:44.480
Speak.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.320
What is it?

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.670
Well, I'm here to thank you

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.150
for saving my life.

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.990
Please.

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:52.990
And?

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:55.120
Your Grace,

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.960
you lent me a hand,

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.120
healing me with your Demonic Ether.

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:00.240
It was simply like

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.670
bringing the dead back to life.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:02.870
A flawless cure.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.440
The touch of a master healer.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.280
Please, here you go.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:12.600
Your Grace,

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:13.720
you know,

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.510
our spiritual power is connected.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:16.720
So you can't just walk away.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.910
Why not help me save my master

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:19.790
while you're here?

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:22.960
No.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:24.390
He'll survive anyway.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.360
I just want to see

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.670
how he makes a fool of himself.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.380
(Explicit Paintings)

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.720
Helping the wicked.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.150
Aren't you afraid of divine retribution?

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.160
Oh dear.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.720
You're so uncooperative.

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:09.000
You'll have to endure some hardship.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.420
Chun'er.

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:16.960
As expected, nothing there.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.270
Filthy and impure.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.840
Let me tell you,

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.360
it's fine to be stubborn for now.

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:28.240
But when serving Lady Serpent,
you must be sweet.

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.030
Or you'll lose your life.

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:31.420
Don't say I didn't warn you.

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:34.360
I even have to apply the mark myself.

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:52.840
Qiu'er.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.840
Dress him up properly.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:00.720
Not bad.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.550
Lady Serpent will surely be pleased.

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:41.870
Evil demons,

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:43.510
how dare you try to seize me, an immortal.

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:46.440
Today I shall uphold justice
on Heaven's behalf.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:05.920
Ms. Luo.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.360
Demon Sovereign,

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.390
that rascal Hong Zhua,

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:09.390
and Ji Li

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:11.000
fell into Hunling City together.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:11.840
What?

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.510
His Grace fought fiercely with Hong Zhua.

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.320
And the three fell into Hunling City.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:19.900
Their powers must be constrained.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.440
In that case,

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.030
let's take this chance

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.240
to end both Hong Zhua and Ji Li.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.630
This one looks rather decent. Take him.

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:43.630
This one...

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.990
Take him too.

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:51.390
Your Grace,

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:52.240
- let's
- Move.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.130
pretend to be a couple.

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:54.720
- Hurry.
- Couple?

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.750
You're a single man.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:00.080
You must protect yourself well.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.960
My master has already been taken.

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:04.480
If I don't shield you,

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.720
what if you're captured too?

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:09.720
(I'm still counting on you to save him.)

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:11.200
(You mustn't be captured.)

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.870
This one's not bad, take him along.

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:15.150
- Lord Commander!
- Honey.

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:16.390
Lord Commander, this is my man.

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:18.150
We're married, please let him go.

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:19.840
He's a tribute for Lady Serpent Immortal.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.480
Being chosen is a blessing for you.

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:22.600
Drag her away.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.240
No, don't!

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.540
- Lord Commander.
- Beware Lady Serpent's wrath.

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:34.680
Why do you want to enter?

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.720
I heard the festival
of Lady Serpent is coming.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.670
We're going to try out
for the maid selection.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:42.390
You.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.360
Yes, you. Come over.

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:46.720
Lord Commander.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.550
This... this is my elder sister.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.030
She has trouble with her mind.

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:52.200
She's plain looking
and might startle you.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.320
Step aside.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:58.030
This little beauty looks quite fine.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.670
Go, go, move along.

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:06.590
Next.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.790
Take this one away as well.

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.160
Your Grace, Your Grace.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.440
Please, don't be upset.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.400
It was only a matter of expedience.

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:32.550
If you dare toy with me again,

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:34.680
you'll be done for.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.480
Lady Serpent descends to the Mortal Realm.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.680
Everyone, make way.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.610
Tonight at the Midnight Hour,

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:49.510
Lady Serpent Immortal graces
the mortal world with her blessing.

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:51.510
Ji Ling shall be chosen anew.

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:54.200
Please rise.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.050
Why should I kneel?

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:57.160
You two dare offend Lady Serpent Immortal.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.720
Lower your heads and kneel, now.

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:00.550
Serpent Immortal?

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:02.110
Lady Serpent Immortal

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:03.750
descends to the Mortal Realm.

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:05.880
Everyone, make way.

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:08.440
Lady Serpent Immortal

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.070
bestows grace upon the world

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:12.030
at the Zi Hour.

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:14.550
Ji Ling shall be chosen anew.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.070
(Ji Li and Lady Serpent Immortal)

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:28.720
(look exactly alike.)

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:37.080
♪Thin wisps of smoke weave
through the river♪

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:44.030
♪Melodies and wine fade,
drunk beneath the sunset♪

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:50.770
♪Lonely light and sword shadow
sway the falling leaves♪

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:57.070
♪Laughing at my recklessness
in this life♪

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:04.440
♪You come to mein every way♪

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:11.550
♪Filling my dreams
with tangled love and hate♪

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:18.510
♪All my best years were for you♪

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:25.320
♪At the far edge of the world
where lanterns fade♪

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:32.860
♪Through the mortal dust,
time flows with its trials♪

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:39.970
♪Joys and sorrows ease grief♪

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:45.840
♪At dusk, petals fall
as winter snow carries the starlight♪

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:52.460
♪Across endless lifetimes,
the ballad endures♪
