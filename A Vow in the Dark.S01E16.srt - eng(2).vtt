00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.350
What a stench.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.350
Smelly bamboo shoot noodles again?

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.480
Only after Ying Ge left did I remember:

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.680
This stuff cures everything,

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.620
a remedy for every ill,

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.320
perfect for strengthening your body.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.920
I have internal injuries;

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.760
I fear this thing

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.200
will only make them worse.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.480
Then you must eat it.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.680
It's guaranteed to heal you,

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.880
tailor-made for your condition.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.000
If I eat,

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.640
you won't leave?

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.000
Then let's see whether you've caught

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.840
the strange disease

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.640
of spitting blood
the moment I walk away.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.950
Ailments in this world
come in every form;

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:36.950
since you claim it works,

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.230
I might as well

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.070
give it

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.400
a try.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.630
Finish it.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.080
Master!

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.710
Master, why are you here?

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.910
Did Ying Ge

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.080
explain the great war

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.190
to you?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.840
Ji Li,

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.080
Jie Chuan is lying.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.280
On the surface it was war,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.410
but he seized the chance

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.120
to crack the immortals' barrier

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:46.910
and poison your kind.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.360
Now,

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.590
many immortals

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.120
are slipping into losses

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.470
of souls and threads of love.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.120
Even Wasteland show signs.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.000
How vicious.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.520
That's surely his true purpose.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.280
Master, is this a misunderstanding?

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:12.910
Could this be a mistake?

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.520
Jie Chuan would never lie to me.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.240
Immortal lives hang by a thread.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.080
The only thing
that can suppress the poison

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.360
is Jie Chuan's Demonic Ether.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.190
You are an immortal.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.000
Will you save them

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.680
or not?

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.800
Of course, I will.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:39.680
Jie Chuan

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.960
will lend us

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.800
his Demonic Ether,

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.520
right?

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.520
You still trust him?

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.150
I have nothing more to say.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.000
Take this Spirit Sensor.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:02.870
It will draw only

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.800
the Demonic Ether from him,

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.910
never harming his life.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.080
The choice

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.470
is yours.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.590
See? I ate every last bit.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.910
What's wrong?

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:57.610
Why do you linger outside?

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:01.920
My master came.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.240
He says the soul-devouring aura
still lingers;

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.630
they need your Demonic Ether
to hold it back.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.940
The soul-devouring aura

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.140
was born from Elder Guo;

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.390
using my Demonic Ether

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.160
is only a temporary fix.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.600
I want to take you back
to the Demon Realm

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.950
and investigate the root of this.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.920
But that will take too long;

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.560
more immortals will die.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.720
Yet given the current situation,

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.270
they'll never trust me;

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:32.390
they'll only use it

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.750
as fresh leverage.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.840
You just don't wish

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.310
to save them, right?

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.520
It's not that.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.400
I just don't think

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.110
things would be so simple.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:49.470
Trust me.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.750
Come back with me tomorrow;

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.240
we'll find a way

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.830
to drive the aura away for good.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.630
I must return first;

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.480
I'll come for you tomorrow.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.390
(As the Soul-devouring Demon expected,)

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.070
(Jie Chuan still wants
to save the immortals.)

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:09.630
(How ridiculous.)

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.400
(Ji Li,)

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.120
(I can't let you keep bewitching him.)

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.870
(Your Grace,)

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.000
(if you can't sever this bond,)

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.070
(I'll sever it for you.)

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.360
The soul-devouring aura?

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.920
But Elder Guo is dead.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.750
Can it rise again?

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.480
This is the cave
of the last soul search.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:17.720
Jin Li's spirit body

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.040
is really in Wasteland.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.510
Is the plan

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:22.350
still on track?

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:23.790
Yes.

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:28.390
The soul-devouring aura

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.480
has seeped through the cracked barrier

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.630
into the Immortal Realm.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:32.720
Soon,

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.720
every immortal

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.800
(That voice sounds like...)

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.630
will be a walking corpse.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.760
Then

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:39.870
we'll seize the Immortal Realm

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:41.560
with ease.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.750
With Jin Li's help,

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.730
you'll surely become the sovereign

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.800
of both realms.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:51.160
(Luo Cha...)

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.390
(Could the mastermind be...?)

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:56.040
(Master was telling the truth?)

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:07.880
Jin Li,

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:13.350
wait for me.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:15.600
Whether it's Elder Guo

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:17.630
or Ji Li,

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:19.630
I will pay any price

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.360
to save you.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.030
Stop acting.

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:33.790
Ji Li has already gone.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.280
(Ji Li,)

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.510
(I came back)

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:09.150
(to prepare a surprise for you.)

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:10.840
(But I don't know)

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.320
(whether you'll like it.)

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:21.750
Your Grace,

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.320
such a grand Blossom-Dyeing Festival.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.510
What are we celebrating?

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.910
I am to be wed.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:50.630
Ji Li,

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:52.000
why so downcast?

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:54.440
Last night,

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.320
I dreamed
of the Demon-subduing Immortal.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.630
She rebuked me

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.360
for leaving the Immortal Realm in peril.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.790
A fragment of her soul lingers in you,

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.440
so nightmares bloom.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:08.790
The Demon-subduing Immortal

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.030
fell centuries ago.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.160
Let it go.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:15.030
That fall

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.120
was hundreds of years ago.

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:19.480
Have you ever thought of seeking her?

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.200
Ji Li,

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.790
the one beside me now

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:24.920
is you.

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:26.870
Her whereabouts

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.120
are no concern of mine.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.320
Then

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:32.910
what if

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:34.010
the Demon-subduing Immortal

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.320
came begging you

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:37.910
to save the immortals

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.180
with your Demonic Ether?

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.990
Ji Li,

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:43.550
it's not that I refuse;

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:47.130
I simply won't be played
by Feng Tian's provocation.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.720
The great war has just come to an end.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:53.000
Why would he stake

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:55.750
his people's hope on demons?

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:57.560
It reeks

00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:59.240
of a scheme.

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.960
I have battled him

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.630
a thousand years;

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.480
I know him.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.280
Fine.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:08.510
Alright.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.200
I understand.

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:11.670
One last thing.

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:12.720
Where were you

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.560
just now?

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:16.350
I...

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:19.060
I've been in the Demon Realm.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:20.940
Affairs piled up,

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:22.100
so they took

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.250
some time.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.850
You must've grown impatient.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.440
(You're still lying.)

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:30.360
(Jie Chuan,)

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.600
(how can I ask you)

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.200
(why you lie to me?)

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.870
Haven't you always wanted
to bring me back?

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:44.750
Let's go.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:45.840
Really?

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.840
You're willing to come with me?

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:50.960
As an immortal criminal,

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.280
I can never go back.

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:55.590
Ji Li.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.080
How defiant!

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:09.480
A mere lesser immortal

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:10.550
dares defy immortal fate!

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:12.540
If I ask her to kill Jie Chuan now,

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:14.870
she'll have to obey,

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.320
let alone use the Spirit Sensor!

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:19.600
Please calm your wrath.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.000
It's a millennium plan
to destroy demons.

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.820
How could you lose control of Ji Li?

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:26.350
Hong Zhua,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.340
how could you make such a mistake?

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.870
Your Grace,

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.080
if Ji Li felt nothing for Jie Chuan,

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.320
Jie Chuan would hardly love her
so deeply.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:35.840
Now,

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:37.790
the fish-bone mark within her
is complete;

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.600
tomorrow, whatever the cost,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.440
I will bring her back

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:43.200
and finish the great plan.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.440
Good.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.720
After she's back,

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:50.910
keep a close eye.

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:55.120
As long as we're ready
for Jin Li's return,

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:57.230
I don't care

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.390
where she is.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.240
I saw Jin Li's spirit body

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.000
in a cave west of Wasteland;

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:15.590
Jie Chuan

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.790
was there as well.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.720
Her spirit body is in Wasteland?

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:23.630
The place
in the Serpent Spirit's memory?

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:29.560
Now,

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.030
Jie Chuan has

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.600
the soul-devouring aura

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:35.790
and Jin Li's spirit body,

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:38.440
yet he feigns innocence.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:41.960
Ji Li,

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:45.390
I don't know how he fooled you,

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.320
but by now

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:49.270
you must see

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.840
Jie Chuan is the mastermind.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.220
He intends to take the Immortal Realm

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:56.000
once and for all.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.390
Once he returns to the Demon Realm,

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:02.630
he will rally fresh legions

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.150
and march straight on us.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:05.840
If...

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.870
If he wanted me dead,

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:10.080
why did he save me?

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.870
Feng Tian has fought him

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:15.390
for over a thousand years

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:17.780
without gaining the upper hand.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.270
His kindness toward you

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:23.870
might only be a stratagem.

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:26.750
You must not let his affection

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.670
doom all immortals.

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:40.350
I understand.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.200
I will

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.280
think again.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:47.550
You don't have much time.

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:49.390
Tomorrow,

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.550
Jie Chuan returns to the Demon Realm;

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.320
tonight

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.750
is your final moment to decide.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:12.670
Ji Li already misunderstands.

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:14.370
Whether Jie Chuan and she

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:16.130
ever meet again in this life

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.630
depends on tomorrow's festival.

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:21.960
Then tomorrow

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.080
shall give them an unforgettable memory.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.030
Are you certain your aura will work?

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:32.030
I cannot afford

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.170
to leave any evidence behind.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.150
Rest easy.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.030
My method of uprooting love

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.080
is silent without a trace.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.270
Once used,

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:41.840
it'll sever all affection

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:42.910
and bring more power.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.480
The effect is outstanding.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:54.960
♪Thin wisps of smoke weave
through the river♪

00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:01.920
♪Melodies and wine fade,
drunk beneath the sunset♪

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:08.640
♪Lonely light and sword shadow
sway the falling leaves♪

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:14.960
♪Laughing at my recklessness
in this life♪

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:22.320
♪You come to me in every way♪

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:29.440
♪Filling my dreams
with tangled love and hate♪

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:36.400
♪All my best years were for you♪

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:43.200
♪At the far edge of the world
where lanterns fade♪

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:50.720
♪Through the mortal dust,
time flows with its trials♪

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:57.840
♪Joys and sorrows ease grief♪

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:03.720
♪At dusk, petals fall
as winter snow carries the starlight♪

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:10.320
♪Across endless lifetimes,
the ballad endures♪
