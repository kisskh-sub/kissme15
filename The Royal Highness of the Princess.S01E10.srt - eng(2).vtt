My Lord, one thing for another.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.040
I think that candied hawthorn stick is quite nice.

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:51.079
Tasty and cheap.

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:52.079
I'll buy you one.

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:57.439
You think one candied hawthorn stick will satisfy me?

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.760
Then what do you want?

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:04.599
Stinky beggar! Stinky beggar!

00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:07.719
You're an eyesore here. Please, stop hitting him.

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:08.280
Stinky beggar!

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.159
Spare me!

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.240
Do you know...

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.919
...my father is Prefect of the Capital, Official Guan!

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.639
I...

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:15.719
Who dares to be so bold?

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.400
You're blocking my way.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.680
It's you again, you idiot.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.360
Last time you ruined my painting,

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:24.479
and humiliated me at the auction.

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:25.639
I haven't settled that score with you yet!

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.039
You are...

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.960
You idiot!

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.960
I...

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:51.360
I...

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:57.759
Ch-Chief Grand Secretary! I, I...

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.879
You have quite the nerve.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.439
Daring to lay hands on my person.

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.639
My Lord.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.520
My Lord, spare me!

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:05.080
I failed to recognize your eminence.

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.680
Relying on your father to act like a tyrant.

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:10.599
It seems the Prefect of the Capital needs replacing.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.879
My Lord, spare me!

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.560
My Lord, spare me!

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.439
I know I was wrong.

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:16.120
My Lord, spare me! My Lord, spare me!

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.639
Get lost.

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.639
Right away!

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.120
Aren't you leaving yet?

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:24.240
Thank you, My Lord.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.879
Thank you, My Lord.

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:28.960
Thank you, My Lord.

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:39.919
Am I hallucinating?

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.879
With so many people, don't get lost.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:45.960
On the main street...

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:47.719
...it's not proper to be pulling and tugging.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:49.800
If you run off,

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.919
what about my ten thousand taels of silver?

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.120
My Lord.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.840
What exactly do you want?

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.280
The trinkets at this stall are quite interesting.

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:03.639
You pick one.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.360
M-Miss.

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:07.400
Just browsing.

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:09.960
These precious knives and short blades are all quite nice.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.840
Pick any one.

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.680
I'll give it to you.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.759
Then I'll pick one for you.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.519
This one's interesting.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.600
How about I give you this one?

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:26.720
M-Miss.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.360
Th-This short blade...

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.360
...costs only one tael of silver.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.079
Buy one, get two free.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.600
B-Buy one, get two free.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.439
Th-This bottle is f-fake blood.

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:46.240
Th-This bottle is...

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:46.879
F-For... spr-spring...

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:47.560
Take them all to use.

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:48.519
Aphrodisiac.

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:56.800
Let's skip this one.

00:04:57.759 --> 00:04:58.199
Miss.

00:04:58.959 --> 00:05:00.959
Th-This one sells very well.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.399
Buy one, get two free.

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:04.360
A-A great bargain.

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:06.360
I thank you.

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:10.720
This...

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.279
You two, please come inside.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.399
Please browse freely.

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:24.759
So expensive!

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.279
Heavens!

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:42.519
Please.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.240
You're not trying to swindle me, are you?

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:51.879
Young master truly has an eye for quality.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.680
This Auspicious Knot is a new treasure in our shop.

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:57.759
Legend says the token of love between the King and Queen of the Nine Provinces

00:05:58.319 --> 00:05:59.519
was the Auspicious Knot.

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:02.959
They lived a life of love and sweetness.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:03.839
So?

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:07.319
This Auspicious Knot is perfect to give to your beloved.

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:09.839
How much?

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:12.319
Five thousand taels.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.319
She'll pay ten taels.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:16.879
I'll cover the rest.

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:19.680
Understood, understood.

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:21.480
Young master is so considerate.

00:06:25.079 --> 00:06:25.879
Have you chosen?

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.199
How much is it?

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:36.000
Ten taels.

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:37.279
Ten taels?

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.720
That's right, miss.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.319
This Auspicious Knot is made from top-grade jade.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.279
There's only one like it in all the world.

00:06:43.959 --> 00:06:44.519
What?

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:45.480
Unwilling to buy it?

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.519
Don't buy this.

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:51.519
And don't buy from this shop.

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:53.199
Let's go look somewhere else.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.319
I think...

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.000
...the Auspicious Knot is nice.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.680
Why are you so stubborn?

00:06:58.879 --> 00:06:59.879
It's not worth it, you know?

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:04.759
I looked around.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:05.800
In this shop,

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.319
there's nothing below a thousand taels.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.639
This Auspicious Knot is only ten taels.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.279
Something's definitely fishy.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.600
So?

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:16.959
So...

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:18.399
...this Auspicious Knot

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:20.160
is definitely a fake.

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:24.680
Don't look at me like that.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.600
Even though the jade's texture is good,

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.079
it's definitely an imitation.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.680
No matter how real it looks,

00:07:31.839 --> 00:07:32.759
it's still a fake.

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:35.800
"Made from top-grade jade"?

00:07:35.959 --> 00:07:37.439
"Only one in all the world"?

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.160
He's taking us for fools.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.399
My Lord, you're brilliant.

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:44.360
You mustn't fall for his trick.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.600
I want it even if it's fake.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.879
You're incredibly foolish.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.000
Shopkeeper.

00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:56.160
I'll take this Auspicious Knot.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:57.680
Excellent!

00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:11.639
My Lord, I've arrived.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.680
You followed me to the Meng residence?

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.680
You're not planning to swindle me again, are you?

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.120
One thing for another.

00:08:21.319 --> 00:08:22.800
I already bought you the Auspicious Knot.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:25.839
Now hurry inside.

00:08:52.879 --> 00:08:54.120
Meng Shaojue's birthday.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.080
Yuwen Rui will also attend.

00:08:56.399 --> 00:08:57.200
Why is he going?

00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:01.279
What's his purpose?

00:09:03.559 --> 00:09:04.919
Send more top-tier assassins.

00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:06.240
This time,

00:09:06.759 --> 00:09:08.320
there must be no mistakes.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:09.960
Understood.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:16.919
Young Master Meng

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.480
Happy birthday, Young Master Meng. Thank you, thank you.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.200
I apologize for the poor hospitality.

00:09:19.679 --> 00:09:20.080
Please, both of you, have a seat.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:20.879
Not at all, not at all.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:21.919
Here.

00:09:23.679 --> 00:09:24.279
Coming.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.440
Young Master Meng, happy birthday.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.200
Thank you, thank you.

00:09:26.559 --> 00:09:27.679
My apologies for the poor hospitality.

00:09:27.759 --> 00:09:28.519
Please, take your seats first.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.080
Shaojue.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.320
Zixiu.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.240
Happy birthday.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.600
May all your wishes come true.

00:09:36.039 --> 00:09:36.600
Thank you.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.879
Fourth Princess, Commander He.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.480
Even the Chief Grand Secretary is here.

00:09:47.159 --> 00:09:47.679
What?

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.519
Young Master Meng doesn't welcome me?

00:09:50.519 --> 00:09:51.120
Brother Meng.

00:09:51.399 --> 00:09:52.519
Look what gift I brought for you.

00:09:58.759 --> 00:10:00.919
Nothing beats giving real gold and silver.

00:10:01.159 --> 00:10:01.799
Brother Meng.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:02.720
Do you like it?

00:10:03.799 --> 00:10:04.600
A gift from Zixiu.

00:10:04.799 --> 00:10:05.519
Of course I like it.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.879
Today, we drink until we're drunk.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:08.639
Until we're drunk.

00:10:08.879 --> 00:10:09.519
Please, come inside.

00:10:11.559 --> 00:10:12.320
I didn't expect...

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.840
...Eldest Cousin to come celebrate Young Master Meng's birthday.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.559
Just boredom.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.799
Brother Xu.

00:10:34.039 --> 00:10:35.720
Brother Xu, it really is you!

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.360
I was just thinking this morning...

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.519
...if I'd run into you again.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.519
Why are you wearing a sword now?

00:10:42.799 --> 00:10:45.320
Is swordplay your troupe's new act this year?

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:48.679
Brother Xu.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.480
You haven't forgotten me, have you?

00:10:50.679 --> 00:10:51.799
I'm Keyan.

00:10:53.559 --> 00:10:54.039
Right.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.559
I'm wearing a veil.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.919
My face hasn't been feeling well lately.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.960
Brother Xu, do you remember?

00:11:01.279 --> 00:11:03.240
Three years ago, at the master's birthday...

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.159
...your troupe came too.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.039
Back then...

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.960
...you helped chase away an old ruffian for me.

00:11:11.159 --> 00:11:11.960
Of course I remember.

00:11:12.559 --> 00:11:13.200
Really?

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:15.919
I'm so happy Brother Xu remembers me!

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.960
What are you doing here?

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:19.840
Are you lost?

00:11:20.519 --> 00:11:21.960
The main hall is over there.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.120
Should I take you there?

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.080
No need.

00:11:24.399 --> 00:11:25.360
I can go by myself.

00:11:27.559 --> 00:11:28.919
See you next time, Brother Xu!

00:11:49.399 --> 00:11:50.200
Try this dish.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.240
Young Master Meng, come, come.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.360
You like this one.

00:11:55.279 --> 00:11:56.080
Thank you, Seventh Cousin.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.279
I'll step out for a moment.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.039
Alright.

00:11:58.039 --> 00:11:58.840
You're too kind.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:11:59.919
It's our honor.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.679
Come, come, Young Master Meng.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.080
Let me toast you again.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:11.080
Alright.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.080
Fill Young Master Meng's cup.

00:12:12.559 --> 00:12:13.039
Here.

00:12:42.519 --> 00:12:44.120
I just ran into someone from Prince Ning's faction.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.919
He disguised himself as a performer and infiltrated the Meng residence.

00:12:47.639 --> 00:12:48.320
Are you alright?

00:12:48.919 --> 00:12:50.240
If something happened, would I be standing here?

00:12:52.519 --> 00:12:55.000
We just don't know how many of them have infiltrated.

00:12:55.279 --> 00:12:56.360
With so many guests here...

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.720
...if anything happens to anyone...

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.840
I have my people among the guests.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.039
I guarantee no one will come to harm.

00:13:05.639 --> 00:13:06.279
You...

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.480
This skin is...

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.440
I call this double insurance.

00:13:30.639 --> 00:13:31.440
I'll be going now.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.519
It took me several nights to embroider this.

00:13:42.039 --> 00:13:43.080
Brother is sure to like it.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:46.720
Commander He.

00:13:51.159 --> 00:13:52.039
Meng Shaojue's birthday.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.600
You are responsible for protecting Miss Meng.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.320
And you are, miss?

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.080
I am the young lady of the Meng residence.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.279
Meng Yinglu.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:04.159
Commander He.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.600
It's said that since childhood...

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.879
...you have mastered all martial arts manuals.

00:14:09.519 --> 00:14:10.360
Your martial skills are exceptional.

00:14:12.159 --> 00:14:13.600
I admire you immensely, My Lord.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.480
I see that you, Miss Meng...

00:14:18.679 --> 00:14:19.480
...have an extraordinary bone structure.

00:14:19.759 --> 00:14:20.519
Your inner force is quite remarkable.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.320
How about we find a place to spar?

00:14:26.679 --> 00:14:27.320
Right now?

00:14:29.399 --> 00:14:31.120
Or perhaps another day.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.840
Today is my brother's birthday.

00:14:34.159 --> 00:14:35.720
I must go celebrate with him.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:38.840
Miss.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.000
Miss!

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:42.679
I hired artists...

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.759
...to draw several hundred copies as you instructed.

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:48.159
Post them in every alley of the capital.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.600
I refuse to believe...

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.519
...we can't find that scoundrel surnamed He.

00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:53.120
Yes.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.039
Well then, Commander He...

00:14:59.919 --> 00:15:00.879
...I'll take my leave.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:12.840
Come, come.

00:15:13.639 --> 00:15:14.519
Come, come, please.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.360
Shaojue.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.279
My eldest brother is actually a good person.

00:15:21.519 --> 00:15:23.000
You'll know if you spend more time with him.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.039
Right, A Zi?

00:15:25.919 --> 00:15:27.639
More contact? I'd rather not.

00:15:30.559 --> 00:15:31.279
Young Master Meng.

00:15:31.759 --> 00:15:32.960
My father is unwell.

00:15:33.159 --> 00:15:34.200
He asked me to relay a message.

00:15:34.639 --> 00:15:36.159
He asks when you will go drink with him.

00:15:37.039 --> 00:15:37.960
Tell the Old Marquis not to worry.

00:15:38.399 --> 00:15:40.519
Tomorrow, I'll bring two jugs of fine wine to visit.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.120
Fourth Princess.

00:15:44.759 --> 00:15:46.320
Meeting the Fourth Princess at the Meng residence today...

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.480
...is truly an honor for me, Li.

00:15:48.919 --> 00:15:51.000
I wonder if the Fourth Princess could spare a moment to speak privately?

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:07.759
If I'm not mistaken...

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.120
...His Majesty intends for Young Master Li to be the Prince Consort.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.000
Young Master Li is the heir of a marquis.

00:16:15.279 --> 00:16:16.879
He has achieved much at a young age.

00:16:17.399 --> 00:16:20.000
He would be a good match for the Fourth Princess.

00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:36.000
Zixiu.

00:16:37.639 --> 00:16:38.600
Haven't you noticed...

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.600
...you care too much about the Fourth Princess?

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:44.720
I... I see her as a younger sister.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.519
Of course I care.

00:16:45.919 --> 00:16:46.879
Is she really just a sister to you?

00:16:58.399 --> 00:17:00.519
I say this because I see you as a good brother.

00:17:01.519 --> 00:17:02.759
If you truly like her...

00:17:03.559 --> 00:17:04.839
...then boldly confess your feelings.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.720
So you won't regret it in the future.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.039
Fourth Princess, please.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:18.759
Seventh Cousin

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:20.480
What's wrong?

00:17:21.279 --> 00:17:21.880
It's nothing.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.359
Come on, come on, come on.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.200
Come on.

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:26.039
Drink, drink, drink! Come on!

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:46.640
It's you.

00:17:47.359 --> 00:17:48.079
You actually...

00:17:50.759 --> 00:17:51.440
Miss Meng.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:52.720
My apologies.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:05.519
Xiao Hei.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:06.720
Xiao Hei!

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.599
Where did Commander He go?

00:18:17.599 --> 00:18:18.279
Young Master!

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.200
The young lady is missing!

00:18:26.359 --> 00:18:27.599
I've searched everywhere.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:28.880
I couldn't find the young lady anywhere.

00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:31.079
I'll go look.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:39.480
Miss Meng.

00:18:40.079 --> 00:18:40.720
Sorry.

00:18:43.119 --> 00:18:43.680
Trying to run?

00:18:47.359 --> 00:18:47.960
Miss Meng.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:49.359
Are you alright?

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.119
You...

00:18:56.839 --> 00:18:58.319
Miss Meng, you dropped something.

00:18:58.839 --> 00:18:59.319
You...

00:19:09.079 --> 00:19:09.839
This way.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.920
From now on, you will clean the master's study.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:23.799
You must especially remember...

00:19:26.079 --> 00:19:26.920
Guards!

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.039
Go!

00:20:02.359 --> 00:20:04.319
Last time it was also you who broke into the Meng residence.

00:20:05.359 --> 00:20:05.839
Speak!

00:20:06.359 --> 00:20:07.680
Why did you break into my Meng residence?

00:20:09.839 --> 00:20:11.359
You won't escape this time.

00:20:39.839 --> 00:20:40.519
What's that smell?

00:21:36.799 --> 00:21:38.119
In the original plot,

00:21:38.799 --> 00:21:40.599
Xiao Hei wouldn't die in this fire, would he?

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.440
Exactly.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000
In the original plot,

00:21:48.759 --> 00:21:50.559
the assassin only wanted to steal the map secretly.

00:21:51.039 --> 00:21:51.960
Unexpectedly, Xiao Hei...

00:21:52.119 --> 00:21:53.039
knocked over the candlestick.

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.440
The room caught fire.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.880
The entire courtyard was lost.

00:21:57.559 --> 00:21:58.799
Those who died, besides Xiao Hei,

00:21:59.359 --> 00:22:00.119
were Auntie Fu,

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:01.880
and this maid,

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.119
and three servants who later rushed to fight the fire.

00:22:06.759 --> 00:22:09.039
Then why didn't you just have me save people directly?

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.559
This drama spirit has thought it through carefully.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.079
That's five people.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:15.680
With just you alone,

00:22:16.519 --> 00:22:17.799
could you manage them all?

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:18.880
You...

00:22:19.319 --> 00:22:20.720
But by having you save Xiao Hei,

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.440
you'd inevitably be running after it all day.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.079
Naturally, you'd discover the room was on fire.

00:22:27.079 --> 00:22:29.279
Thus, you could stop the fire at its source.

00:22:30.279 --> 00:22:31.119
And save everyone.

00:22:32.839 --> 00:22:35.200
I'm secretly lowering the difficulty for you.

00:22:35.319 --> 00:22:36.839
Shouldn't you thank me properly?

00:22:37.359 --> 00:22:38.960
Thank *you*?

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.359
Fortunately, no one was hurt.

00:22:40.599 --> 00:22:42.000
Otherwise, I wouldn't let you off the hook.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.039
In short,

00:22:44.319 --> 00:22:44.960
congratulations.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:45.599
Mission successful.

00:23:38.279 --> 00:23:39.279
The hidden weapon is poisoned.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.440
Young Master Meng, don't worry.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.000
This poison is not fatal.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.039
But if you forcefully use your inner force,

00:23:46.359 --> 00:23:48.480
I'm afraid your meridians will be severed.

00:23:49.279 --> 00:23:50.799
Even without your inner force,

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:53.240
you are no match for me.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.839
Young Master Meng is indeed formidable.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.519
But you must be feeling quite uncomfortable now.

00:24:12.839 --> 00:24:16.440
Young Master Meng, do you know of the Map of the Nine Provinces?

00:24:18.119 --> 00:24:19.119
What if I do?

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.799
Tell me where the map is hidden.

00:24:22.039 --> 00:24:22.920
And I'll spare your life.

00:24:25.039 --> 00:24:26.359
Wishful thinking.

00:24:27.559 --> 00:24:29.079
You won't yield until you see your coffin.

00:24:37.279 --> 00:24:38.839
Take this hidden weapon: Rainstorm of Pear Blossom Needles!

00:24:42.039 --> 00:24:43.000
How dare you trick me!

00:24:43.319 --> 00:24:44.880
Young Master, are you alright?

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.960
You... get out of here!

00:24:51.279 --> 00:24:52.720
Young Master Meng, you'd better be sensible.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.880
Tell me where the Map of the Nine Provinces is.

00:24:55.799 --> 00:24:56.880
If you don't speak,

00:24:57.319 --> 00:25:00.079
today may be your last day.

00:25:02.039 --> 00:25:03.000
I know where the map is.

00:25:03.559 --> 00:25:04.279
Let the young master go,

00:25:04.759 --> 00:25:05.640
and I'll take you to the map.

00:25:06.279 --> 00:25:07.839
Nonsense! Get out of here!

00:25:11.119 --> 00:25:12.400
How do you know where the map is?

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:17.400
While cleaning, I found a secret room in the Qiushui Garden.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.160
As long as you release the young master,

00:25:19.599 --> 00:25:20.519
I'll take you there.

00:25:26.079 --> 00:25:26.640
Move.

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.039
Don't worry, Young Master.

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:33.680
I'll be fine.

00:25:35.559 --> 00:25:36.359
Some things...

00:25:38.559 --> 00:25:39.680
I'll explain to you later.

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.240
Commander He is nowhere to be found.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.200
Why hasn't even Young Master Meng returned yet?

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:16.880
Let's go check.

00:26:30.119 --> 00:26:30.799
You go that way.

00:26:30.799 --> 00:26:31.400
I'll go this way.

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:32.559
Be careful.

00:27:08.599 --> 00:27:09.359
Where is the secret room?

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:33.759
Get in.

00:27:40.079 --> 00:27:40.799
Where is the map?

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.559
The Map of the Nine Provinces...

00:28:50.359 --> 00:28:51.240
This one is interesting.

00:28:51.559 --> 00:28:52.480
How about I give you this one?

00:28:56.559 --> 00:28:57.319
Fifth Princess...

00:28:58.039 --> 00:28:59.720
I will give you a proper burial.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.960
Should it be a burial or cremation?

00:29:08.359 --> 00:29:09.119
My Lord.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:14.200
H-help... help me!

00:29:15.559 --> 00:29:16.720
How long are you going to keep pretending?

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.640
I was just indulging my acting bug.

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.000
I didn't expect to fool you.

00:29:28.039 --> 00:29:29.240
Luckily, I was clever

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:30.960
and carried this thing with me.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:32.880
My Lord.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.960
The assassin being able to steal the fake map...

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.839
I deserve some credit, right?

00:29:50.039 --> 00:29:50.920
Where is she?

00:29:52.079 --> 00:29:53.880
Young Master Meng forced his acupoints open.

00:29:54.519 --> 00:29:55.960
Aren't you afraid your meridians will be severed,

00:29:56.519 --> 00:29:57.680
and you'll die suddenly?

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.079
Enough talk.

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.200
Where is she?

00:30:16.519 --> 00:30:17.319
The assassin has been spotted!

00:30:20.359 --> 00:30:21.000
Over there!

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:40.640
Be careful yourself.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:56.720
A Zi, be careful!

00:31:06.359 --> 00:31:07.119
Seventh Cousin!

00:31:13.079 --> 00:31:13.400
I'm fine.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:14.000
Are you okay?

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:14.960
I'm fine, I'm fine.

00:31:16.519 --> 00:31:17.200
Are you alright?

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:18.440
I'm fine, don't worry.

00:31:19.039 --> 00:31:19.880
Hurry and bandage the wound.

00:31:38.839 --> 00:31:39.440
Young Master Meng

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.039
Shao Jue

00:31:40.359 --> 00:31:40.960
Young Master Meng

00:31:41.119 --> 00:31:41.640
Shao Jue

00:31:41.799 --> 00:31:42.759
Young Master Meng, wake up!

00:31:43.119 --> 00:31:43.759
What happened?

00:31:43.759 --> 00:31:44.279
Shao Jue

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:58.480
Zixiu

00:31:59.319 --> 00:32:00.240
Haven't you noticed

00:32:00.599 --> 00:32:02.200
you care too much about the Fourth Princess?

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.759
I... I see her as a sister.

00:32:05.759 --> 00:32:06.640
Of course I care.

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:07.960
Is she really just a sister?

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:13.519
A Zi

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:14.640
That's enough.

00:32:22.839 --> 00:32:23.440
Doctor

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:24.480
Is Shao Jue alright?

00:32:26.319 --> 00:32:28.039
Young Master Meng forcibly used his inner force

00:32:28.279 --> 00:32:29.640
and then broke through his own pressure points.

00:32:30.039 --> 00:32:31.599
Now his heart meridians are damaged.

00:32:31.799 --> 00:32:33.559
He must not use inner force for two years.

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:35.559
Is there any way

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:36.839
to help him recover quickly?

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.880
He won't die, at least.

00:32:47.359 --> 00:32:48.000
Eldest Brother

00:32:48.319 --> 00:32:50.079
Now's not the time for sarcasm.

00:32:54.279 --> 00:32:55.960
It's the Soul-Returning Pill His Majesty awarded to Eldest Brother.

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:57.680
It can protect the heart meridians.

00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:58.799
Doctor, look.

00:32:59.559 --> 00:33:00.400
If he takes this medicine,

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.480
Young Master Meng only needs to avoid

00:33:02.759 --> 00:33:04.559
forcibly using inner force for a month.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.000
Don't misunderstand. I'm not doing this for you.

00:33:15.359 --> 00:33:15.880
Eldest Brother

00:33:16.359 --> 00:33:17.920
You must be doing this for my sake.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.440
Lord Yuwen is so kind.

00:33:21.519 --> 00:33:22.079
I doubt it's...

00:33:22.079 --> 00:33:22.799
Quick, take one.

00:33:26.559 --> 00:33:29.599
This old man will go write a prescription for Young Master Meng.

00:33:34.039 --> 00:33:35.839
Young Master Meng, do you know the assassin's identity?

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:42.119
The assassin likely stole the Map of the Nine Provinces.

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.960
The Map of the Nine Provinces was in the Meng residence?

00:33:48.519 --> 00:33:49.680
I only learned of it today as well.

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.720
The assassin was pressing for the map's location.

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:55.160
Young Master Meng, rest well.

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:58.200
I will report the theft to Father.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:02.400
Take your medicine properly.

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.279
I'm leaving.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.920
I wonder if they'll understand the farewell letter.

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:31.119
Brother Hei

00:34:31.559 --> 00:34:32.880
Take good care of yourself from now on.

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:35.519
I prepared some snacks you like.

00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:37.960
Goodbye.

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:53.400
Oh, right.

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:55.480
I didn't take the prescription the doctor gave for Seventh Cousin.

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:56.719
I'll go back and get it.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:57.599
A Zi

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:12.920
Miss

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:16.760
A Lan

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:42.440
Seventh Cousin

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:09.599
So you, this fool, have been pretending to be dumb and tricking us?

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.079
Eldest Brother, you knew all along?

00:36:16.239 --> 00:36:17.119
I'm sorry.

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:19.039
I didn't mean to.

00:36:19.719 --> 00:36:21.159
That day after I was poisoned,

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.320
I lost my memory.

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.360
I could only protect myself by pretending to be dumb.

00:36:26.239 --> 00:36:27.519
I couldn't remember anything.

00:36:30.079 --> 00:36:33.039
But I quite like how things are now.

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:34.159
Of course.

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.559
You're much cuter now.

00:36:41.519 --> 00:36:42.239
Imperial Sister

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.199
I didn't mean to deceive you.

00:36:52.159 --> 00:36:55.119
This cup of wine is an apology for the past.

00:37:03.679 --> 00:37:06.039
This cup is for deceiving you all.

00:37:13.119 --> 00:37:13.840
What's past

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:15.119
is past.

00:37:18.559 --> 00:37:19.199
Little silly.

00:37:19.639 --> 00:37:21.440
Then why did you run off to the Meng residence?

00:37:23.519 --> 00:37:24.760
That day you took me out of the palace,

00:37:25.039 --> 00:37:26.480
I saw you were busy gambling,

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:27.599
and paid no attention to me.

00:37:28.199 --> 00:37:29.639
Just then, I was mistaken for

00:37:29.639 --> 00:37:31.360
a poor, homeless girl.

00:37:31.519 --> 00:37:32.559
They gave me some silver

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.079
and told me to be a maid at the Meng residence.

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:35.920
So I...

00:37:36.719 --> 00:37:38.159
deliberately ran off to the Meng residence.

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:39.000
You made me worry!

00:37:42.719 --> 00:37:43.480
You... you... you...

00:37:44.239 --> 00:37:44.760
Forget it.

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:46.800
Seventh Cousin is magnanimous.

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:47.760
I won't hold it against you.

00:37:48.679 --> 00:37:51.400
As expected of my world's most handsome Seventh Cousin!

00:37:56.239 --> 00:37:56.760
A Lan

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:58.119
If there's nothing else,

00:37:58.480 --> 00:37:59.760
come back to the palace with me later.

00:38:02.239 --> 00:38:03.519
His Majesty currently believes

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:06.079
the Fifth Princess is at my villa treating her dementia.

00:38:06.559 --> 00:38:07.679
She can return to the palace in two days.

00:38:08.519 --> 00:38:08.960
Therefore...

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:09.400
No.

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:14.440
Why not?

00:38:16.199 --> 00:38:18.760
Eldest Cousin, you should know perfectly well.

00:38:22.199 --> 00:38:23.000
Speak plainly.

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:34.440
Eldest Cousin meets with dancers at night and hides a man.

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.199
A Lan going to your villa...

00:38:37.639 --> 00:38:38.480
I'm not at ease with that.

00:38:41.119 --> 00:38:43.719
I imagine the Fifth Princess wouldn't mind.

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.400
Fifth Princess, don't you have something to say?

00:39:01.159 --> 00:39:05.480
Actually, the dancer Eldest Cousin met at night,

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:07.719
and the hidden man...

00:39:09.119 --> 00:39:10.079
were both me.

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:23.599
The details...

00:39:23.719 --> 00:39:25.199
I'll explain to you all later.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:30.440
Rufeng will pick you up for the villa later.

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.519
Then I'll come to the villa to find you first thing tomorrow.

00:39:37.159 --> 00:39:37.679
Alright.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.719
Eldest Cousin, come back to the palace with me

00:39:41.239 --> 00:39:43.480
to report the treasure map theft to Father.

00:39:45.679 --> 00:39:46.239
Come on, come on.

00:39:46.239 --> 00:39:46.760
Eat, eat, eat.

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:48.440
Eat.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.320
Your servant presumptuously used a fake map

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:00.199
to replace the real Map of the Nine Provinces at the Meng residence.

00:40:00.679 --> 00:40:01.519
I beg Your Majesty for forgiveness.

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:05.639
Since you know it's a crime,

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:08.960
why didn't you report it to me beforehand?

00:40:11.159 --> 00:40:11.960
The enemy is hidden, we are exposed.

00:40:12.199 --> 00:40:13.519
The fewer who know, the better.

00:40:14.239 --> 00:40:14.760
Furthermore,

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.119
the map was in Grand Preceptor Meng's hands.

00:40:16.639 --> 00:40:18.480
He has always believed your servant has ulterior motives.

00:40:19.239 --> 00:40:20.239
If he knew of this,

00:40:20.679 --> 00:40:22.519
he would vehemently oppose your servant's plan.

00:40:25.719 --> 00:40:28.320
What poison did Eldest Cousin put on the fake map?

00:40:28.719 --> 00:40:29.440
Bone-Corroding Powder.

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:31.320
Anyone who touches the fake map

00:40:31.639 --> 00:40:33.039
will show symptoms of poisoning after three days.

00:40:33.559 --> 00:40:34.760
The veins on their wrists will bulge,

00:40:35.199 --> 00:40:36.039
resembling slithering snakes.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.400
If they cannot get the antidote in time,

00:40:38.519 --> 00:40:39.519
they will surely die.

00:40:50.519 --> 00:40:53.519
This is the treasure map that everyone in the world covets.

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.159
Now the map is in our hands.

00:40:56.679 --> 00:40:57.519
The urgent task now

00:40:58.519 --> 00:41:00.639
is to locate the former number one faction,

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:02.480
the Shadow Gate.

00:41:02.639 --> 00:41:03.639
The Shadow Gate has long been in decline.

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:05.639
Its disciples have all vanished into the Jianghu.

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:07.159
Finding them

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.440
will likely not be easy.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.880
Hasn't His Majesty also been sending people to find the Shadow Gate?

00:41:11.519 --> 00:41:13.280
We just need to get there before him.

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.000
Your Highness,

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:20.440
Yuwen Rui must know the map is with you now.

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:24.199
Why not let me safeguard it instead?

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:27.039
Rest assured,

00:41:28.039 --> 00:41:31.039
I will never let the treasure map fall into others' hands.

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:35.559
We shall wait three days,

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:37.920
to see how you find the map thief.

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:39.280
Yes.

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:40.800
Father,

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.039
To prevent the thief from becoming suspicious,

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:44.880
why not have Commander He

00:41:45.159 --> 00:41:46.760
investigate the map's whereabouts with full effort?

00:41:48.159 --> 00:41:49.039
Let it be done as you say.

00:41:50.159 --> 00:41:50.679
By the way,

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:52.199
how is A Lan?

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.199
The Fifth Princess's condition has improved.

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:56.719
The divine healer said she may fully recover in a couple of days.

00:41:59.039 --> 00:42:01.159
Have the divine healer treat A Lan with all his skill.

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.440
If A Lan regains her senses,

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.320
We will surely reward him handsomely.

00:42:06.519 --> 00:42:07.039
Yes.

00:42:11.519 --> 00:42:12.039
My Lord,

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:15.519
Where is the Fifth Princess?

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:16.719
Resting in the courtyard.
