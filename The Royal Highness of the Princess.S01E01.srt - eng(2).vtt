00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:48.400
Out of the way! Move!

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.680
Get out of the way, quick!

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:01.640
Princess.

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:02.640
We've arrived at Yuwen Manor.

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:04.920
Open the gate!

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:06.400
Open up!

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:21.960
I refuse to believe it.

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:24.159
This marriage can't be called off?

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:25.759
The Fifth Princess is here! Open the gates!

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:33.960
We were unaware of Your Highness's arrival.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.800
We failed to welcome you properly.

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:36.240
We beg for your forgiveness, Princess.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.879
Where is Yuwen Rui?

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:39.120
Your Highness,

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.840
My lord has gone out of the city on business.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.599
He hasn't returned yet.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.159
Then tell him to return immediately.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.240
Since Yuwen Rui isn't here,

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.919
I'll have to amuse myself with you all.

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:06.599
Fifth Princess,

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:09.840
may I ask the purpose of your visit?

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.360
You should ask your lord that.

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:25.520
Who knows what kind of potion

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.680
Yuwen Rui fed to my royal father?

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.280
Father actually wants me to marry him.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.080
What?

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.159
Eager to become the Prince Consort?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.639
Princess,

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.280
the marriage contract between you and my lord

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.240
was arranged by the late Empress Dowager.

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:40.560
If you are unwilling, Princess,

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.479
my lord would never force you into distress.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.800
Everyone knows he'll use any means

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.280
to climb higher.

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:49.120
Forget it.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.520
Why am I telling this to a lowly servant like you?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.199
When exactly will he be back?

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.639
I've already sent word to my lord.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.879
Fifth Princess,

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.560
perhaps you'd like to rest for a while?

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:08.240
How about...

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:11.080
giving Yuwen Rui a big gift?

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.959
Cut! That's a wrap for this scene.

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:27.639
Come here.

00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:30.000
This stand-in actress you found

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.839
is quite good.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.680
Thank you, Director.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.680
Let's cast her as An Kelan instead.

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:40.920
Tell the one who injured her leg clubbing last night

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.040
not to come.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.879
Okay, understood, Director.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.079
Hey, bro.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.879
You're here.

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:45.279
So, uh,

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:47.000
are the actors' backup costumes ready?

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.920
They're ready.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.920
The director already told me.

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:50.240
The one in the back, move forward a bit.

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:53.240
Sweetie,

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.519
that's good.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.120
You're really my lucky star.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.879
I never thought coming to visit you on set

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:59.879
would land me a role.

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:00.839
Of course! Let's go.

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:05.079
I heard that

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:07.319
the role of An Kelan doesn't have many scenes.

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:09.199
Indeed, not many.

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:10.879
She's a minor cannon fodder who dies in episode one.

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:12.279
Don't look down on cannon fodder.

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:13.120
Cannon fodder are people too.

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:15.480
So, what's our show

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.920
actually about?

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:18.759
Apart from the scene we just shot

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:19.839
and the leads' names,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.959
I know nothing.

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:23.399
This story is roughly about...

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:24.279
It's a tale where

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:26.480
a group of people vie for supremacy,

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.560
fighting over the Map of the Nine Provinces.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.279
In the end, few meet a good fate.

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:30.160
The year's most bizarre drama.

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:32.279
The year's most bizarre drama.

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:33.160
You've hit on the key point.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.720
Our show

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:37.759
has innocent cannon fodder dying horribly every few episodes.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.319
The causes of death are varied,

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:40.680
and the methods are diverse.

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:41.759
By the grand finale,

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:43.439
a whole swath of cannon fodder have perished.

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:44.680
Characters who get a peaceful end

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.560
are few and far between.

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:49.879
The character you're playing, An Kelan,

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.639
in the first episode,

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:52.680
is poisoned at her own birthday banquet.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.160
After being poisoned, the Fifth Princess looks like she's just asleep.

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:56.959
The imperial physicians can't figure out what poison it is.

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:58.079
They try every method,

00:05:58.199 --> 00:05:59.319
but the Fifth Princess doesn't wake up.

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:00.480
Not long after,

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.000
she kicks the bucket.

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:04.000
She's a vile cannon fodder,

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:05.120
so her death is deserved.

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:06.160
It's a satisfying outcome.

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:07.000
You know what?

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.839
Director Ling not only made a special appearance

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:10.000
as a minor character in the show,

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:13.000
but also based the character Yuwen Rui

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.759
on his own older brother, CEO Ling.

00:06:15.079 --> 00:06:16.279
What kind of person

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:18.360
is Yuwen Rui?

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:19.720
Good day, CEO Ling.

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:20.279
Good day, CEO Ling.

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:21.600
Ruthless methods,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.160
immense power at court,

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:23.800
vengeful to the core,

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.519
extremely protective of his own.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.480
Nicknamed the Grim-Faced Yama.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.720
The legendary number one treacherous official.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.920
Don't tell me

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.120
CEO Ling is also a penny-pinching devil?

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.160
CEO Ling is here!

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.160
CEO Ling!

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.519
What I meant just now was...

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.040
Watch out!

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:21.600
Welcome.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.759
Miss Anran.

00:07:24.079 --> 00:07:24.759
Who are you?

00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:28.439
Where is this?

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.000
A film set.

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:34.560
Was I just knocked out?

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.120
I don't seem to be hurt.

00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:40.600
You...

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.680
Am I hallucinating?

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:49.759
Spare my life!

00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:50.439
Fifth Princess!

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.079
Have mercy!

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.279
Fifth Princess, please.

00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:03.680
We're starting the shoot now.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.279
Where's the director?

00:08:16.839 --> 00:08:17.519
Where's the cameraman?

00:08:18.759 --> 00:08:20.160
Where are the crew members?

00:08:21.279 --> 00:08:21.920
Princess.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.720
If Lord Yuwen sees this upon returning to the manor,

00:08:25.399 --> 00:08:26.519
it wouldn't be good, would it?

00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:30.439
Wait.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.519
You're really hitting them!

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:37.159
Does the princess think my strength is insufficient?

00:08:41.759 --> 00:08:42.240
Princess.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:43.399
Is this acceptable to you?

00:08:46.399 --> 00:08:46.919
Princess.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.320
Please spare their lives, Princess.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.480
Spare us, Princess! Spare us!

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:53.320
Stop!

00:08:55.399 --> 00:08:56.679
Let them down at once!

00:08:59.039 --> 00:08:59.799
Why are you just standing there?

00:08:59.799 --> 00:09:00.559
Hurry up!

00:09:01.159 --> 00:09:02.039
Yes, yes, yes.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.639
Welcome, Miss Anran.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.679
What are you looking for, Princess?

00:09:25.559 --> 00:09:27.519
Did you see a young man in red clothes?

00:09:27.679 --> 00:09:28.679
He was just here.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.799
What young man in red?

00:09:30.919 --> 00:09:32.840
You've been alone in this room the whole time.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.639
Are you perhaps looking for me?

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.639
Who are you, really?

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.120
How did I get here?

00:09:47.039 --> 00:09:47.600
Princess?

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.399
Who are you talking to?

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.200
Over there.

00:09:54.399 --> 00:09:55.919
Did you see anything?

00:09:58.519 --> 00:10:00.279
I didn't see anything.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.399
Xixi, you...

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.639
Pinch me.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.480
I wouldn't dare.

00:10:18.399 --> 00:10:19.000
Xixi.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.039
Xixi!

00:10:27.519 --> 00:10:29.519
Congratulations on entering the Script World.

00:10:29.919 --> 00:10:31.919
Character bound: An Kelan.

00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:34.639
Sc-Script World?

00:10:37.919 --> 00:10:38.399
And me?

00:10:38.759 --> 00:10:39.320
I am a Plot Spirit.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.240
My name is Hong Yi.

00:10:46.639 --> 00:10:48.399
My main duty is to record

00:10:49.039 --> 00:10:51.320
and arrange the life and death of cannon fodder in the script.

00:10:52.759 --> 00:10:54.039
You brought me here?

00:10:58.399 --> 00:10:59.519
Ultimately,

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.519
it's because this drama of yours is too bizarre.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.919
Every few episodes, innocent cannon fodder die tragically.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.399
This truly violates the Script World's

00:11:07.519 --> 00:11:10.519
principle of respecting life, peace, and friendship.

00:11:11.039 --> 00:11:11.399
No.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.840
What does cannon fodder dying have to do with me?

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.639
Cannon fodder dying innocently one by one,

00:11:18.639 --> 00:11:20.159
isn't that a setting created by you humans?

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.240
Your setting

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:23.440
naturally needs to be corrected by yourselves.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.440
And you,

00:11:25.799 --> 00:11:28.159
with your statement "cannon fodder are people too,"

00:11:28.879 --> 00:11:30.039
have been selected by this Plot Spirit.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:35.840
Don't look down on cannon fodder!

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:36.639
Cannon fodder are people too!

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.559
I just went to visit a friend on set.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.399
I just picked up a role to play.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.360
And now I've become Fifth Princess An Kelan?

00:11:48.279 --> 00:11:49.279
No choice.

00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:52.240
Who told you to be the Chosen One?

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.279
Chosen my foot!

00:11:54.519 --> 00:11:55.240
I'm not worthy.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:55.759
I refuse.

00:11:56.559 --> 00:11:57.240
Sorry,

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.399
refusal invalid.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.799
Only by completing the assigned mission to save cannon fodder

00:12:01.799 --> 00:12:03.240
can you return to the real world.

00:12:04.399 --> 00:12:05.080
Friendly reminder:

00:12:05.879 --> 00:12:08.559
The missions will become increasingly difficult.

00:12:09.039 --> 00:12:10.120
You have one and only

00:12:10.519 --> 00:12:12.320
one chance to fail.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.120
An Kelan herself

00:12:18.679 --> 00:12:20.120
is just cannon fodder, isn't she?

00:12:21.799 --> 00:12:22.519
So,

00:12:22.799 --> 00:12:24.320
your first mission is

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.080
self-preservation.

00:12:28.679 --> 00:12:31.279
I'll cheer you on in spirit.

00:12:41.799 --> 00:12:43.000
Heaven never seals off all exits.

00:12:43.159 --> 00:12:44.080
It's not the final moment yet.

00:12:44.559 --> 00:12:45.200
There's still a chance.

00:12:47.559 --> 00:12:49.200
Are you alright, Princess?

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:50.720
I'm fine.

00:12:51.879 --> 00:12:53.799
When is my birthday?

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.399
It's today.

00:13:03.639 --> 00:13:07.440
Heaven wants to finish me off!

00:13:11.559 --> 00:13:12.159
Princess.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.840
Why did you think today

00:13:13.879 --> 00:13:16.360
to arrange a physician to treat the servants of Yuwen Manor

00:13:16.679 --> 00:13:17.919
and even reward them with silver?

00:13:22.759 --> 00:13:23.519
Master! Master!

00:13:23.879 --> 00:13:24.559
The Fifth Princess is here!

00:13:31.159 --> 00:13:35.759
Today, this old man will tell the story

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.679
of Yuwen Rui, one of the Four Young Masters of Yunmi.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.679
Four Young Masters of Yunmi?

00:13:43.519 --> 00:13:44.480
Have you forgotten, Princess?

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.200
On the Yunmi Young Masters Ranking,

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:46.960
Young Master Meng,

00:13:47.159 --> 00:13:47.799
Young Master Xiu,

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.720
Lord Yuwen,

00:13:48.799 --> 00:13:50.480
and Commander He are the top four.

00:13:50.679 --> 00:13:53.960
They are commonly known as the Four Young Masters of Yunmi.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.000
To this day,

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.159
there's actually still a "Four Young Masters" setting?

00:13:58.159 --> 00:13:59.480
Above tens of thousands,

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:00.799
Furthermore,

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.279
he... he is a great...

00:14:04.799 --> 00:14:06.399
great treacherous official!

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:07.720
Stop the carriage!

00:14:08.399 --> 00:14:09.799
At a young age,

00:14:11.519 --> 00:14:13.320
he went to the battlefield.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.799
He kills without batting an eye,

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.639
thirsting for blood as if for life itself!

00:14:21.639 --> 00:14:23.519
How dare he slander Lord Yuwen in public!

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.320
He must have a death wish!

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.519
Does this storyteller want to die,

00:14:29.519 --> 00:14:30.799
or does he not want to live?

00:14:31.159 --> 00:14:31.759
Princess,

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.639
this was all arranged by you.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.000
I've had a terrible headache all day today.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.720
I can't remember many things right now.

00:14:43.879 --> 00:14:46.080
This Yuwen Rui,

00:14:46.759 --> 00:14:48.200
has the heart of a wolf, ambitious

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.360
and... and blatantly obvious!

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.159
This was personally written by you, Princess.

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.200
I never imagined

00:14:53.279 --> 00:14:54.720
Your Highness had such literary talent.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.639
So eager to offend people...

00:14:58.039 --> 00:14:59.679
Do I want to die,

00:14:59.679 --> 00:15:00.679
or do I not want to live?

00:15:00.679 --> 00:15:04.080
Using his own power to eliminate dissidents,

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:08.840
he... he is a complete and utter treacherous official!

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:14.360
Who is this?

00:15:17.159 --> 00:15:17.879
Look, look.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.120
What does it say?

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.120
The Lone Star of Calamity, Yuwen Rui.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.279
He brings ruin to father, mother, and kin.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:32.799
Harboring ill intent, all may punish him.

00:15:34.279 --> 00:15:39.480
This... this wasn't also my doing, was it?

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.960
This would offend him completely!

00:15:46.639 --> 00:15:48.480
Why has Fifth Princess stopped reading?

00:15:50.799 --> 00:15:51.200
Princess?

00:15:51.519 --> 00:15:54.080
It seems... it's Lord Yuwen.

00:15:56.879 --> 00:15:57.679
He, he, he...

00:15:57.679 --> 00:16:03.039
He, Yuwen Rui, actually dares to covet the Fifth Princess!

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.240
He covets the position of Prince Consort!

00:16:05.759 --> 00:16:08.799
One day, he will surely stir up chaos.

00:16:09.759 --> 00:16:11.879
And bring disaster to the court.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.039
Master! Master!

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.120
Let's run!

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.080
Fifth Princess is shocked.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:30.399
No.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:31.919
That's good then.

00:16:32.799 --> 00:16:33.480
Fifth Princess.

00:16:33.879 --> 00:16:35.480
We'll meet at the birthday banquet.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.120
Princess.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:43.879
Are you alright?

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.000
This servant will have them clear the inn.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.279
So you can change your clothes.

00:16:54.519 --> 00:16:56.120
Aside from storming into his manor...

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.600
And trying every way to slander him...

00:16:57.879 --> 00:16:59.879
I didn't do anything else to offend Yuwen Rui, did I?

00:17:00.639 --> 00:17:01.679
The year the Princess was eight...

00:17:01.919 --> 00:17:03.559
...she forcibly took a hairpin from Lord Yuwen.

00:17:03.919 --> 00:17:06.599
That hairpin was a memento of Lord Yuwen's mother.

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:07.200
It's fine, she...

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.279
Why would I steal a memento of someone's mother?

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.160
When Lord Yuwen's mother passed away...

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.440
...she left behind only one hairpin.

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:16.759
His lordship treasured that hairpin above all.

00:17:17.279 --> 00:17:18.680
Who would have thought, after the Princess saw it...

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.039
...she snatched it by force.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.359
Yuwen Rui surely wouldn't...

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:24.559
...hold a grudge over just a hairpin.

00:17:24.559 --> 00:17:24.960
Right?

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:26.960
This servant does not know.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.359
But...

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.359
Lord Yuwen held his late mother...

00:17:30.359 --> 00:17:31.039
...in the highest esteem.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.839
Once, there was a servant...

00:17:32.839 --> 00:17:34.559
...who spoke improperly of his lordship's mother behind his back.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.880
Later, that servant...

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:37.519
...what happened?

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.200
...suddenly vanished.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.440
And couldn't be found anywhere.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.839
Could the poisoner be Yuwen Rui?

00:17:45.799 --> 00:17:48.000
No, I must think of a way.

00:17:58.119 --> 00:18:00.039
Does the Princess feel unwell anywhere?

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.559
Everywhere is uncomfortable.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.559
My heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys all hurt.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.640
I feel like I'm about to die.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:08.640
Princess.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.400
Your pulse is completely normal.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.880
Please don't tease this humble official.

00:18:14.799 --> 00:18:15.480
You don't understand.

00:18:17.559 --> 00:18:19.400
I really am about to die.

00:18:19.759 --> 00:18:21.000
The Princess is blessed by heaven.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.680
You will surely live a long life.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.720
If only there were a universal antidote.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.880
Princess, this humble official will go inquire about it.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.000
Imperial Physician Chen!

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.319
I beg you!

00:18:34.319 --> 00:18:36.359
Please, see my mistress quickly!

00:18:36.359 --> 00:18:37.680
Princess, this servant will go see.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.039
Imperial Physician Chen!

00:18:40.039 --> 00:18:40.680
How dare you!

00:18:41.079 --> 00:18:42.960
Who allowed you to barge into Fifth Princess's chambers?

00:18:44.519 --> 00:18:45.160
Fifth Princess!

00:18:45.319 --> 00:18:46.880
Please show mercy!

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.279
We beg you!

00:18:48.279 --> 00:18:49.319
Just allow Imperial Physician Chen...

00:18:49.319 --> 00:18:51.079
...to go treat our mistress.

00:18:51.279 --> 00:18:52.680
It's all my mistress's fault.

00:18:52.839 --> 00:18:54.559
She shouldn't have offended you in the imperial garden.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.000
She shouldn't have picked the flowers you planted.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.359
She shouldn't be thinner than you!

00:18:59.599 --> 00:19:02.960
But our mistress didn't mean it!

00:19:03.839 --> 00:19:04.480
Imperial Physician Chen.

00:19:05.079 --> 00:19:07.519
Go and take a good look at their mistress.

00:19:10.799 --> 00:19:11.799
Fifth Princess, rest assured.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:15.880
I will definitely take a good look at their mistress.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:17.440
No.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.680
What I mean is...

00:19:20.119 --> 00:19:21.839
Take a *good* look.

00:19:22.279 --> 00:19:23.559
A *very* good look.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.039
Understand?

00:19:26.039 --> 00:19:27.039
Fifth Princess, rest assured.

00:19:27.319 --> 00:19:29.079
This humble official understands completely.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.319
How can Fifth Princess be so cruel?

00:19:32.319 --> 00:19:33.759
Aren't you afraid of retribution?

00:19:34.519 --> 00:19:36.359
Retribution is already on its way.

00:19:37.359 --> 00:19:38.440
Why have you all come here?

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.640
Fourth Princess has arrived.

00:20:04.359 --> 00:20:06.079
This cool, noble aura...

00:20:06.319 --> 00:20:07.920
...it's clearly the female lead, An Kezi.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:08.880
Fourth Princess.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:12.440
Fifth Princess won't allow the physician to see our mistress.

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:14.839
Imperial Physician Chen.

00:20:15.319 --> 00:20:16.480
Aren't you going to take a proper look?

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:18.440
This...

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.640
I also just told Imperial Physician Chen...

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.400
...to take a good look at their mistress.

00:20:26.039 --> 00:20:26.680
Right?

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:28.119
Yes.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.039
The Princess did indeed say that.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.640
Fifth Princess's "good look"...

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.119
...how could it be the same as Fourth Princess's?

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.119
Is this perhaps...

00:20:38.119 --> 00:20:40.200
...the difference between the female lead and a vicious cannon fodder?

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.480
Even reckless behavior should have its limits.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:45.480
Imperial Physician Chen.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.079
Are you still not going?

00:20:48.359 --> 00:20:48.799
Yes.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.200
Thank you, Fourth Princess.

00:20:55.839 --> 00:20:56.519
Royal Sister.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.119
I'm feeling a bit unwell.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.200
Perhaps you should keep your distance.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.680
Lest you catch my illness.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:06.880
Royal Sister.

00:21:08.279 --> 00:21:09.559
Only in front of Father Emperor...

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.799
...do you call me Royal Sister.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:13.920
Is that so?

00:21:15.559 --> 00:21:17.799
I must be too ill...

00:21:18.039 --> 00:21:19.200
...and a bit confused.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.279
The trick of feigning illness to cancel the birthday banquet...

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.319
...you just used it yesterday.

00:21:43.119 --> 00:21:44.720
The Princess is taller than this servant.

00:21:53.359 --> 00:21:54.319
When Father Emperor arrives later...

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:55.559
...remember to give a loud signal.

00:21:56.119 --> 00:21:56.759
Yes, Princess.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.440
We pay respects to Your Majesty.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:05.960
So fast?

00:22:06.359 --> 00:22:07.799
The Emperor truly dotes on Fifth Princess.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.039
The hanging method might work.

00:22:14.079 --> 00:22:15.079
Princess, quick!

00:22:17.119 --> 00:22:18.000
Get up there, get up there!

00:22:20.079 --> 00:22:23.519
Princess, you mustn't do this!

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:25.519
If you do this...

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:29.279
...this servant will have failed Consort Chen!

00:22:29.279 --> 00:22:30.920
Princess!

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:31.480
A Lan

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.559
If you'd rather die than marry Yuwen Rui

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.359
then your father can

00:22:34.359 --> 00:22:36.440
Please, don't die!

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.920
If you die, this servant won't want to live either.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.400
Your Highness, please, stop acting.

00:22:41.759 --> 00:22:42.680
You're overdoing it.

00:22:49.559 --> 00:22:51.160
You truly are my good daughter.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:52.200
Let me tell you,

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.519
the birthday banquet must be held.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.079
I will also publicly announce

00:22:55.319 --> 00:22:56.559
your wedding date with Yuwen Rui.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:01.599
Your Highness,

00:23:01.799 --> 00:23:03.079
it was this servant's fault.

00:23:12.079 --> 00:23:15.799
It seems we must use the final move.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.519
Where's a dog hole?

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.240
A Lan.

00:23:30.279 --> 00:23:31.480
Where are you off to?

00:23:41.599 --> 00:23:43.559
This peerlessly handsome face...

00:23:44.039 --> 00:23:45.359
Could it be the male lead, Yuwen Xiu?

00:23:53.079 --> 00:23:53.559
So,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.640
the pose I just used to swoop down,

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.519
was it exceptionally dashing?

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.079
This 'handsome for less than three seconds'

00:24:00.079 --> 00:24:01.680
and mysteriously confident look...

00:24:02.359 --> 00:24:03.480
probably can't be the male lead.

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.480
Seventh Cousin is asking you a question.

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.200
Why aren't you answering?

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
Great. It really is the male lead.

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.039
Are you trying to...

00:24:25.799 --> 00:24:26.480
elope?

00:24:28.319 --> 00:24:29.039
Keep your voice down!

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:30.519
Keep your voice down!

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:35.359
Guards! The Fifth Princess is trying to elope!

00:24:35.519 --> 00:24:37.640
The Fifth Princess is eloping!

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.400
Someone, quick!

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.480
Guards!

00:24:44.599 --> 00:24:45.720
The marriage hasn't even been arranged yet!

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:46.839
What kind of elopement is that?

00:24:47.119 --> 00:24:47.640
A Lan,

00:24:48.279 --> 00:24:49.599
Seventh Cousin is doing this for your own good.

00:24:50.279 --> 00:24:51.359
For my own good?

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.039
Let me tell you the truth.

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.640
Right now, all the gambling houses in the city,

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:56.480
big and small, have opened a betting pool.

00:24:56.799 --> 00:24:58.119
Betting on whether you'll marry our eldest cousin.

00:24:58.759 --> 00:25:00.279
I've placed a bet of ten thousand taels

00:25:00.279 --> 00:25:01.799
that you two will definitely get married.

00:25:02.359 --> 00:25:03.599
The odds are one to a hundred!

00:25:04.079 --> 00:25:05.200
Once I get that million taels,

00:25:05.359 --> 00:25:06.359
I'll give you half.

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:07.880
Consider it your birthday gift.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:08.960
So,

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.000
isn't Seventh Cousin very generous?

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:13.960
Generous?

00:25:14.759 --> 00:25:15.599
So generous.

00:25:17.559 --> 00:25:20.920
I heard you want the universal antidote.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.440
Imperial Physician Chen is asking around everywhere.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.640
It's all over the palace.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.359
I'd also like to find this medicine for you,

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.400
but I don't know where to find it.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:30.960
I wasn't finished talking!

00:25:37.519 --> 00:25:38.240
Your Highness,

00:25:38.559 --> 00:25:40.160
His Majesty has ordered those guards

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.559
to follow you every step of the way.

00:25:42.119 --> 00:25:43.319
It seems he's determined

00:25:43.319 --> 00:25:44.480
to announce at the birthday banquet

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.640
your marriage to Lord Yuwen.

00:25:47.319 --> 00:25:49.400
I'm afraid a funeral will come faster than a wedding.

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.359
Tell me,

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.519
if I apologize properly to Yuwen Rui,

00:25:54.759 --> 00:25:55.960
reflect deeply on my actions,

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.759
and vow to turn over a new leaf,

00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:58.960
would he...

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.599
magnanimously forgive me?

00:26:01.039 --> 00:26:02.119
Your Highness, are you...

00:26:02.279 --> 00:26:04.240
deciding to improve relations with Lord Yuwen?

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.200
If Your Highness is sincere,

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.039
you could certainly try.

00:26:10.759 --> 00:26:13.559
Rumors say Lord Yuwen is ruthless

00:26:14.039 --> 00:26:15.400
and holds grudges over the smallest matters.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:17.799
But in this servant's view,

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.400
Lord Yuwen probably isn't that kind of person.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.599
He is exceptionally handsome,

00:26:22.599 --> 00:26:23.400
with outstanding presence.

00:26:23.759 --> 00:26:25.759
Countless women wish to marry him.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.119
If Your Highness agrees to this marriage,

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.160
in the future you'll be deeply in love,

00:26:30.359 --> 00:26:31.880
and treat each other with respect.

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.920
That's some wild imagination.

00:26:36.319 --> 00:26:37.559
This servant would then

00:26:37.559 --> 00:26:40.039
be worthy of Consort Chen's final wishes.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.079
In that case...

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:44.400
The hairpin!

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.279
Go find the hairpin, quick!

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.599
The one that's Yuwen Rui's mother's heirloom,

00:26:49.599 --> 00:26:50.759
the one I forcibly took from him.

00:26:51.039 --> 00:26:51.519
Go find it!

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.039
We're all brothers here,

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.319
so let's not be so particular.

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.079
Here,

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:14.559
drink this cup of wine.

00:27:15.319 --> 00:27:17.400
From now on, I'll be your little brother.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:18.960
If you tell me to go east,

00:27:19.279 --> 00:27:20.319
I'll never go west.

00:27:21.119 --> 00:27:21.480
Come on.

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:26.400
No.

00:27:27.079 --> 00:27:28.440
Yuwen Rui is heartless.

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:29.920
Without a life-and-death bond,

00:27:30.279 --> 00:27:31.759
how could he possibly see me as a brother?

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.920
If not as a brother, then...

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:44.920
My lord, you are truly so handsome.

00:27:49.559 --> 00:27:53.599
I'll return the hairpin to you.

00:27:58.759 --> 00:28:02.319
Let's just forget the past.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:05.480
What do you say?

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.200
No, no, no.

00:28:09.599 --> 00:28:10.759
That's too disgusting.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.119
What if I act more fragile and pitiful?

00:28:27.759 --> 00:28:29.279
I was blinded by rumors

00:28:30.079 --> 00:28:32.480
and couldn't accept marrying you for a moment.

00:28:33.119 --> 00:28:35.119
That's why I caused that scene at your manor.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.279
Could you forgive me just this once?

00:28:50.519 --> 00:28:51.039
Your Highn...

00:28:54.799 --> 00:28:56.079
You might not know,

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:59.559
I'm a person whose words don't match my heart.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:04.559
My mouth says I detest you, I dislike you,

00:29:05.759 --> 00:29:06.920
but actually...

00:29:13.559 --> 00:29:14.240
Ling Rui.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.039
Actually what?

00:29:19.839 --> 00:29:20.359
Right!

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.440
Yuwen Rui's prototype is Ling Rui.

00:29:24.319 --> 00:29:25.079
Fifth Princess,

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:28.920
actually...

00:29:29.519 --> 00:29:30.000
I...

00:29:31.799 --> 00:29:32.599
admire you.

00:29:33.119 --> 00:29:33.920
I revere you.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.160
I adore you.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.000
The Fifth Princess seems like a different person.

00:29:41.119 --> 00:29:41.759
Is that so?

00:29:42.359 --> 00:29:43.599
People can change.

00:29:45.079 --> 00:29:45.519
By the way,

00:29:45.759 --> 00:29:46.400
your hairpin...

00:29:49.119 --> 00:29:50.759
Didn't the Fifth Princess say back then

00:29:51.119 --> 00:29:52.480
that once something is in your hands,

00:29:53.759 --> 00:29:54.680
it's yours?

00:29:56.279 --> 00:29:57.519
I was immature back then.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.799
I wonder where the poison will be.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.920
What a waste of my favorite grapes.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.000
Come, come, come.

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:31.200
Today is A Lan's birthday.

00:30:31.799 --> 00:30:32.599
Everyone, make yourselves at home.

00:30:34.279 --> 00:30:36.279
Thank you, Your Majesty. Thank you, Father.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:48.160
A Lan.

00:30:48.799 --> 00:30:51.200
Your royal uncle has a gift for you.

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.680
This is made from an auspicious stone.

00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:58.960
Auspicious stone?

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.359
Prince Ning spent half a year in Anzhou.

00:31:02.599 --> 00:31:05.000
Helping the local people deal with a locust plague.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.279
The people were immensely grateful.

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.880
So they presented him with this.

00:31:09.359 --> 00:31:10.240
That is excellent.

00:31:11.079 --> 00:31:11.759
Excellent.

00:31:13.359 --> 00:31:13.839
Your Majesty.

00:31:14.759 --> 00:31:16.759
This humble official also has a gift for the Fifth Princess.

00:31:17.519 --> 00:31:17.960
Good.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:38.960
Does the Fifth Princess like it?

00:31:42.359 --> 00:31:43.039
I like it.

00:31:43.359 --> 00:31:44.319
I like it very much.

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:49.599
May the Fifth Princess be as elegant as the daylily, with lasting youth and beauty.

00:31:49.759 --> 00:31:50.839
May you have this day every year.

00:31:51.319 --> 00:31:52.680
And this moment every year to come.

00:31:54.079 --> 00:31:55.279
That's entirely unnecessary.

00:32:09.359 --> 00:32:10.640
Why isn't the Fifth Princess drinking?

00:32:29.839 --> 00:32:30.799
What's wrong, A Lan?

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:33.640
Father.

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:37.359
A Lan misses Mother Consort.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:39.519
I still remember...

00:32:40.039 --> 00:32:41.039
When Mother Consort accompanied me...

00:32:41.039 --> 00:32:42.839
For my last birthday with her.

00:32:43.359 --> 00:32:46.079
She personally brewed fine fruit wine.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.240
But I...

00:32:48.599 --> 00:32:50.680
Can never drink it again.

00:32:51.319 --> 00:32:54.519
How did I not know Consort Chen could brew wine?

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.640
Father didn't even know that?

00:33:04.559 --> 00:33:07.680
No wonder Mother Consort often lamented in life...

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:09.160
Saying in the next life...

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:12.119
She only wished to be an ordinary couple with Father.

00:33:13.039 --> 00:33:15.559
You'd till the fields, I'd weave the cloth.

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:19.759
You'd carry water, I'd tend the garden.

00:33:20.839 --> 00:33:21.480
That way...

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:25.079
At the very least, we could see each other every day.

00:33:27.839 --> 00:33:30.119
I have wronged your mother consort.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:32.880
This cup of wine...

00:33:33.759 --> 00:33:37.039
A Lan wishes to toast to every little memory with Mother Consort.

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.000
This servant deserves death! This servant deserves death!

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:53.119
Father, you see...

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.160
I'd like to step out and compose myself.

00:33:55.799 --> 00:33:58.200
Alright, alright. Go quickly and return soon.

00:34:05.359 --> 00:34:07.599
Of the thirty-six stratagems, fleeing is best.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.400
Do you know where the map is hidden?

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.079
Not yet.

00:34:16.039 --> 00:34:17.239
We can't just wait forever.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:20.119
I will send someone to investigate the Benevolent Heart Hall.

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:24.880
That was close.

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:29.079
Someone's here.

00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:30.880
This works too?

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.079
Fifth Princess.

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:46.880
Who were those two just now?

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:48.519
This is a story...

00:34:48.519 --> 00:34:50.719
About a group of people fighting for the realm...

00:34:50.719 --> 00:34:51.719
The Map of the Nine Provinces.

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:53.440
In the end, few met a good fate.

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.400
The year's most bizarre drama.

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.920
What they're looking for is the Map of the Nine Provinces.

00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:58.760
Fifth Princess.

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:05.880
Fifth Princess.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.400
This humble official will escort you back.

00:35:07.679 --> 00:35:08.079
That's not necessary.

00:35:08.719 --> 00:35:09.880
I still need to return to the palace to freshen up.

00:35:12.039 --> 00:35:12.760
His Majesty has ordered...

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.360
No matter what the Princess says...

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:15.760
We are to bring the Princess back.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:20.639
By the way...

00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:22.760
Did any of you just see...

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:23.719
Who went that way?

00:35:24.519 --> 00:35:25.079
Reporting to the Princess.

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:26.719
When this lowly officer was searching for you...

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:27.719
I passed by that area.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.119
I think I saw the Chief Grand Secretary.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.360
Yuwen Rui.

00:35:35.639 --> 00:35:37.559
Fifth Princess, please.

00:35:51.559 --> 00:35:52.039
Princess!

00:35:52.239 --> 00:35:53.320
I finally found you!

00:35:54.039 --> 00:35:55.119
Just now, Imperial Physician Chen...

00:35:55.119 --> 00:35:57.599
Sent someone to give me the universal antidote.

00:35:58.159 --> 00:36:00.639
He said he found it from a medicine merchant.

00:36:00.719 --> 00:36:02.079
And told me to give it to you immediately.

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:06.960
I've already removed the beeswax seal.

00:36:07.199 --> 00:36:08.320
You can take it directly.

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.280
If it could be found so easily...

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.519
A universal antidote...

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.199
Then the Fifth Princess in the original story...

00:36:17.719 --> 00:36:18.920
How could she have died from poison?

00:36:23.679 --> 00:36:24.239
Princess?

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:25.920
Where is your jade pendant?

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:47.880
Let's go.

00:36:48.239 --> 00:36:48.599
Yes.

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:54.199
Princess, what's wrong?

00:36:57.079 --> 00:36:57.719
The antidote...

00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:59.719
The antidote is poisoned!

00:37:00.599 --> 00:37:01.119
Fifth Princess!

00:37:01.119 --> 00:37:01.920
Princess!

00:37:02.119 --> 00:37:02.679
Fifth Princess!

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:03.639
Princess!

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:04.559
Go fetch the imperial physicians! Quickly!

00:37:05.079 --> 00:37:05.840
Yes!

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:06.920
Princess! Princess!

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:08.480
Don't scare me like this!

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:09.679
Princess...

00:37:18.679 --> 00:37:19.280
Your Majesty!

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.559
This humble official never found any antidote.

00:37:21.559 --> 00:37:24.239
Nor... nor did I send anyone to deliver medicine to the Fifth Princess.

00:37:24.519 --> 00:37:25.400
I beg Your Majesty to investigate thoroughly.

00:37:25.639 --> 00:37:26.880
I beg Your Majesty to investigate.

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:32.880
Well?

00:37:33.679 --> 00:37:34.159
Your Majesty...

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:35.519
This humble official is powerless.

00:37:35.519 --> 00:37:37.800
I beg Your Majesty for forgiveness.

00:37:38.639 --> 00:37:39.920
A bunch of useless fools!

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.400
What use are you to me?!

00:37:43.079 --> 00:37:45.639
Is there truly no other way?

00:37:50.119 --> 00:37:50.639
Your Majesty.

00:37:51.599 --> 00:37:54.519
This humble official does have one method...

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.760
That... perhaps we could try.

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:06.519
Imperial Physician Chen

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:08.920
This silver needle is too thick.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:10.480
It's almost as thick as a pen.

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.159
If you insert this needle,

00:38:12.599 --> 00:38:13.519
can An Kelan endure it?

00:38:14.199 --> 00:38:15.039
When this needle goes in,

00:38:15.239 --> 00:38:17.079
the pain will be like a spike piercing the heart.

00:38:17.559 --> 00:38:19.480
But it can unblock all orifices and meridians.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.920
It might wake the princess.

00:38:24.519 --> 00:38:24.960
Your Majesty,

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:28.559
the eunuch who delivered the medicine has been found.

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:29.960
Speak quickly.

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.039
He was an orderly from the Imperial Hospital.

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:35.159
Why would that orderly want to poison An Kelan?

00:38:36.079 --> 00:38:36.960
When I found him,

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.239
he had already hanged himself.

00:38:39.079 --> 00:38:42.079
However, in the orderly's room,

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.480
I found a suicide note and a packet of poison.

00:38:45.039 --> 00:38:45.760
The letter states

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:46.880
that a few days ago,

00:38:47.159 --> 00:38:48.920
this man offended the Fifth Princess in the imperial garden.

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.159
The Fifth Princess ordered him to receive thirty cane strikes.

00:38:51.679 --> 00:38:52.639
He held a grudge.

00:39:00.639 --> 00:39:01.119
An Kelan?

00:39:02.159 --> 00:39:02.599
What is it?

00:39:02.599 --> 00:39:02.960
Your Majesty...

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:03.719
Father...

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:05.639
This...

00:39:24.159 --> 00:39:24.800
An Kelan.
