Hong Ye?

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.200
You insignificant human whelp—

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.120
you're not worthy of calling my name.

and have no dealings whatsoever
with the human race.

Now, take your people
and leave this place.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.030
Aren't you coming back with us?

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.300
She's a demon.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.020
She belongs in the demon realm.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.480
But you're clearly human.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:31.030

she's imbued with demonic energy.

Xiao Yao, let's go!

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.710
My Lord, your cultivation
hasn't fully recovered yet.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.090
You shouldn't have forced it
the way you did just now.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.180
It was way too dangerous.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.180
There's a spy.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.590
There must be a spy.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.060
What do you mean?

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.170
How could Xiao Yao possibly be a spy?

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.010
She just protected us

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.250
at Moon-Gazing Terrace.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.540
T-T-That's right.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.829
Without Xiao Yao,

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.940
you might not even have survived
to return to Youning Cave.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:23.740
That's right.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.500
Did I say it was her?

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.470
Besides, everyone saw it.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.940
If it weren't for the traces of
fluorite powder on her,

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.810
Demons' Valley wouldn't
have suffered this disaster.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:34.810
Fluorite powder?

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.200
Yes, she did have fluorite powder on her.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.740
S-So what?

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:39.570
That doesn't prove

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.570
she deliberately brought
the fluorite powder in.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.790
Maybe she got it on her by accident.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:44.370
That's right!

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.230
We all went to the test together,

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.540
yet none of us got any on us—

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:49.950
only she did.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:51.980
He's a blockhead.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.310
Are you a blockhead too?

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:54.860
Exactly.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:55.370
It must be her.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.740
Xiao Yao has always been helping us.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.060
She's been helping us all along!

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.330
You...

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.810
What's with all this arguing?

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.870
Are we having internal conflict now?

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.200
I wouldn't call this internal conflict.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.010
My Lord,

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:11.420
it's just that we suspect Xiao Yao

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.620
of leading the Feiyu Guards
into our Demons' Valley,

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.350
so there's some disagreement.

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:17.570
I didn't.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.260
Then you didn't.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.690
If Xiao Yao says she didn't,
then of course she didn't.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:24.530
After all,

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.180
Xiao Yao was brought here by His Lordship.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.600
She has always enjoyed

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.550
His Lordship's special care.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.140
So you're suggesting

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.280
that both she and I are guilty,

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.600
right?

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.290
My Lord, you speak too harshly.

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.860
But we demons have always been fair
with rewards and punishments.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.620
If Xiao Yao wants us to believe her,

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.130
she needs to provide some

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.990
evidence to prove her innocence.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.470
Lord Heiwu makes a valid point.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.500
Since there's currently
no evidence proving

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.700
that Xiao Yao is a spy,

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.980
she only needs to prove
that she isn't one.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:16.810
So you must have come up with

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.710
some good solution, haven't you?

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.740
The head of the Feiyu Guards
wields a strange blade,

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:22.740
its body dark red—

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.390
not an ordinary weapon.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.540
It seems to harbor a soul

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.300
and bears a deep grudge against our kind.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:32.500
I believe

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.310
that since the Feiyu Guards
are our greatest enemy,

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.550
and with such a formidable weapon,

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.420
if this blade is not eliminated,

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.860
it will eventually become
a hidden threat to us.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.860
If Xiao Yao can bring this blade
back to the demon clan,

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.250
it would not only remove that threat

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.210
but also serve as a good way for her
to prove her innocence.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.010
Hmm.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:59.370
I'll go.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:03.950
I'll go with her.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.100
I believe Xiao Yao is not a spy.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:07.810
I'll go too.

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:08.420
Yes.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:09.500
Yes.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.360
Luoluo, you...

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:12.250
Alright.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:14.890
Let me see.

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:15.690
Here you go.

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:17.090
We've struck it rich!

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.770
My Lord, check out this tortoise shell.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:22.230
It must be 1,000 years old.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.110
Indeed.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.240
I'll send it to your residence later.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:28.910
Dismissed.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:29.810
Yes, sir.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:32.970
There's more over there.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.470
My Lord.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:40.130
What are you lot doing?

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.740
Congratulations on
your great victory, My Lord.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.290
You'll surely be promoted when we return.

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:47.420
Congratulations, My Lord.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.820
Felicitations, My Lord.

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:50.980
Hong Ye escaped,

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.110
and you call that a great victory?

00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.730
Pass on my order:

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.460
continue the pursuit of
the remaining fugitives.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:11.460
Demon Slayer.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:14.180
Perhaps we should return first

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.450
and plan our next move carefully.

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:16.510
After this battle,

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.970
the demons have suffered heavy losses.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.060
We should press our advantage.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:24.470
Why let them off so easily?

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:27.740
My Lord.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.370
The Emperor established the Feiyu Guards

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:31.810
specifically to eliminate demons.

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:33.740
If we truly eliminated all demons,

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:36.940
what purpose would the Feiyu Guards serve?

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:44.380
We must eliminate demons,
but not all of them.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.060
They need to remain
somewhat of a threat to humans

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.260
for our existence to remain necessary.

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:56.450
My Lord.

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:00.590
We know you have a blood feud
with the demons,

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:03.450
but those of us serving under you

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.180
all have families to support.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.340
We truly cannot act as boldly as you do.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:10.450
Please understand our situation, My Lord.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.140
My Lord, shall we

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:24.090
head back?

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.310
Demon Slayer, you're truly wise.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:47.850
Feiyu Guards!

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:48.490
Yes!

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:49.560
Take a headcount.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:50.790
We're heading back!

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:52.930
All hail the Demon Slayer!

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.490
All hail the Demon Slayer!

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.260
All hail the Demon Slayer!

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.330
Demons' Valley isn't safe anymore.

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:05.620
Taking this chance to leave

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:06.810
is your best option.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.790
You already know how to conceal
your demonic energy.

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:13.570
Finding a deserted place to lie low

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:15.370
shouldn't be difficult for you.

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:17.380
I didn't agree to this

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:18.980
to flee at a critical moment.

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:21.780
What I hate most
is being wrongfully accused.

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.450
So I must get that blade

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:25.710
and clear myself of those false charges.

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:28.060
I'm off.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.120
Where are we going?

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:33.810
Xiao Yao.

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:38.810
Be careful on the way.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:41.270
Don't worry.

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:43.610
Even if I encounter any trouble,

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:45.420
I still have this.

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:49.380
Let's go.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.440
So where are we going to find
that demon-slaying blade?

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:53.780
Pingjiang Prefecture.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:55.810
What's Pingjiang Prefecture for?

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:56.940
You'll see when we get there.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:57.490
Alright.

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.730
Didn't you say you'd escort us
out of the valley?

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:11.690
Why are you taking us
up the mountain instead?

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:12.470
Right.

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.090
Before we set off, His Lordship
instructed me

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:18.220
to teach you a life-saving technique.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:20.420
The three of you, think carefully

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:21.610
about what you want to learn.

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:22.670
Anything at all?

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:23.880
Only one?

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.210
I'm afraid you'll struggle to learn
even one.

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:27.650
Well...

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:29.090
I want to learn
cloud-riding technique then.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:30.660
That way, when danger comes,

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.140
I can carry Xiao Yao and Dali on my back

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.090
and fly up into the sky.

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:34.300
Nice thought.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:36.060
But I'm afraid

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.320
there's no cloud in this world
that could bear your weight.

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:41.490
The invisibility technique.

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.180
That way,
humans won't be able to detect us.

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.450
So they won't be able to catch us.

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:45.940
Right! Then we won't even
need to reveal ourselves

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:47.340
to retrieve the blade.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:48.660
Let's learn this one!

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.090
With your limited power,

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:52.780
mastering the invisibility technique

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.380
would take at least 60 years.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.730
Sixty years? That's a bit long.

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:57.890
That's way too long.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.730
I heard there's a demonic art

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:01.490
that can turn leaves into silver.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:02.220
Is that true?

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:03.060
It is true.

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:05.250
That's actually not difficult.

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:07.140
-What's the use of that?
-What's the use of that?

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:08.610
It's extremely useful!

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:11.010
We'll learn this one.

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:14.060
Now that we've learned
the most powerful technique,

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.660
we'll have nothing to worry about
when we get to the human realm.

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:17.410
Will it work?

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:20.510
Let's give it a try.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:28.970
It worked!

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:30.140
It worked!

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.260
-Will this work?
-It's hard. It's hard.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.350
Give it back!

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:35.330
This is extremely useful.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:36.140
Let me tell you,

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:37.450
with this in the human realm,

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:38.850
you'll be treated like royalty.

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:39.730
Really?

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:43.450
To prevent demons from entering the city,

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:44.980
everyone who wants to enter

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:47.270
must be exorcised by the Master first.

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:49.850
Anyone who avoids the holy water exorcism

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:51.450
will be dealt with as a demon.

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:53.250
Next.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:57.810
Why won't my legs stop shaking?

00:12:58.940 --> 00:12:59.970
Your shaking legs are fine,

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:01.840
just keep your nose from showing.

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.180
We should've learned
the invisibility technique instead,

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.310
even if it would take longer to master.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:08.260
What should we do?

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.570
No good. Let's find another way.

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:10.220
Next.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:10.930
Come back.

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.520
Let me show you the power of silver.

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:14.500
Let's go.

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:15.690
Officer. Officer.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:16.730
Officer.

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:18.490
I'm a relative of the Prefect,
coming from his hometown.

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:19.650
There's been a family emergency,

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.530
and I need to report it to him
immediately.

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:23.530
Could you please make an exception?

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:26.180
Come on, next.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:27.330
Let's go. Come on.

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:28.130
Hold on.

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:31.090
A relative of the Prefect, are you?

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:31.660
Yes.

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:33.790
Well then, tell me,

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:35.660
where is the Prefect's

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:36.940
hometown?

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:41.770
Xiyi...

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:42.810
Where?

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:44.830
That's his ancestral home.

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:48.080
He was born in Qizhou.

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:49.410
Qizhou?

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:52.740
And then he grew up in Jian'an.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.220
What is

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:57.660
the Prefect's surname?

00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:59.350
Wang?

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.490
Wang was his surname when he was a child,
inherited from his father.

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:05.090
T-Then he changed it

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:07.010
to his mother's surname, Zhang.

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:10.060
And after that, he changed it again to...

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:10.780
Enough.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:13.810
Next.

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:16.590
As for this ingot of silver,

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.900
consider it a fine.

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:19.850
I'm in

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:22.380
a good mood today,

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:25.220
so I won't take you to the county office.

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:27.520
Come on, use your brain.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.090
If she were really the Prefect's relative,

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:31.620
would she need to bribe you?

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:33.090
If you really want to enter the city,

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:34.940
go to the back of the line
like everyone else.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.940
We're just in a hurry,

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:37.570
so I...

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:38.830
We need to save time...

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:40.350
Come on, let's go.

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:41.430
Let's go. Let's go.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.140
Let's find another way in.

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:44.420
This isn't working at all.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.060
Wait.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:48.400
You don't want it anymore?

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:50.690
Silver!

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:52.660
Who dropped their silver?

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:53.830
Silver! My silver!

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:55.830
Over here!

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:58.570
Right, whose money is this?

00:14:58.570 --> 00:14:59.700
Hurry and pick it up!

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:01.530
H-Hand it all over to me!

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.790
Alright, alright.

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:07.350
We're safe now.

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:09.610
This. I want this.

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:10.440
Sir.

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:11.850
You want to eat me?

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:12.970
This isn't you.

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:13.940
This is me.

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:14.920
This isn't.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:15.940
I'll eat it.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:18.190
How is it?

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.850
So good. Even sweeter than honey.

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:22.430
Have a try.

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:25.840
Good. It's really good.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:26.480
Right?

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:29.690
[Jinxiu Boutique]

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:31.720
Get out.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.390
Is this a place you're supposed to be?

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:39.830
Please come in.

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:47.020
That's pretty!

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:48.950
Not really. I think it's too plain.

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:00.180
What do you think? Is this pretty?

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.280
So beautiful.

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:02.260
Where's Luoluo?

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:02.950
Luoluo!

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.260
Coming, coming!

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:06.940
You're going to be dressed like this?

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.140
Doesn't it look good?

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:09.570
Aren't these the boss's clothes?

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:11.170
Don't they look impressive?

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:16.060
Would you three like to dine?

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:16.540
Yes.

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:17.380
We have private rooms inside.

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:18.080
Please.

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:18.850
Watch your step.

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:19.910
Please be careful.

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:21.440
Come on.

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:22.770
Pig ear salad,

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.210
roasted pig skin,

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:25.970
stewed pig's trotters
and stir-fried pig liver.

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:26.630
No problem!

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:28.720
They can make so many dishes with you!

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:30.410
Wait.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:31.090
Yes?

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:32.540
I don't want any of these.

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:33.090
Aside from these,

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:35.610
bring us one of each dish you have
in your restaurant.

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:37.780
But our restaurant has over 100 dishes.

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.290
Then bring us 10 at a time.

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:41.170
I'm entertaining my friends

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:43.270
and want to try something new.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.090
This is a restaurant,

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:46.190
we sell food,

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:47.540
and we're not afraid of big eaters.

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:48.740
Please wait a moment.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:53.300
You're still not full?

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:55.430
Have you ever been full?

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:56.900
Oh my.

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:57.690
Your nose!

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:00.950
Just eat quietly. Don't snuffle.

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:02.210
You're drawing attention.

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:03.470
Pull your nose back in.

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:04.900
Waiter, bring wine!

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:05.670
Right away!

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:10.530
Xiao Yao, they're demon hunters!

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:11.450
What bad luck.

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:13.540
It's okay.

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:15.700
We're minor demons.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:17.630
They won't be able to sense us.

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:19.099
Don't look. Keep your voice down.

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:20.829
Don't look. Just eat normally.

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.340
Waiter.

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:36.660
Coming.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:37.820
Do you have any private rooms available?

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.820
Sorry, all private rooms are taken.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:42.310
Clear one out

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:43.690
and clean it thoroughly.

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:44.950
Judging by his outfit,

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:46.850
he's from Qionghua Sect.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.050
[Jin Muqing]

00:17:59.050 --> 00:17:59.660
Master.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.970
We've searched
all of Pingjiang Prefecture.

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:03.100
The mortal world is filthy,

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.450
and this is the best restaurant
we could find.

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:08.310
I'm afraid Mistress and Junior
will have to endure.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:09.290
It's fine.

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:11.490
I just want to have some noodles
with my daughter.

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:12.820
No need to trouble them.

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:14.470
Come on.

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:17.340
[Mrs. Jin] [Yunyi]

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:19.140
The first floor is crowded.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.330
Let's eat upstairs.

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:26.140
-There are stairs.
-Be careful.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:26.770
One.

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:27.380
Lift your foot.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:27.940
Two.

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:29.420
Three.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:30.660
Four.

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:34.770
It's said that Jin Muqing,
the master of Qionghua Sect,

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:36.450
is a descendant of Immortal Swordsman,

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:38.770
someone who can drink tea
with the Old Immortal of the South Pole

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:41.630
and play Go with
Lu the Progenitor on Mount Tianzhu.

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:44.520
Why has he descended to
the mortal world today?

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:46.270
The imperial court is offering
a huge reward.

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:46.600
[Huoyun Sect]

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:46.940
[Sect: Qianji Sect;
Residence: Miao Frontier; Weapon: Poison]

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:50.050
Qionghua Sect is also here for
a piece of the action.

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:53.210
So these transcendent beings

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:54.940
are no better than us after all.

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:58.470
-They're also into those worldly things.
-Here comes the soup!

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:02.420
Are you asking for trouble?

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:03.140
Do you have a death wish?

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:04.210
I'm terribly sorry, gentlemen!

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:04.860
I'm terribly sorry!

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:05.250
Get lost!

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:06.340
I'll go get a cloth right now!

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:07.400
I'll go right away!

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.570
[Jifeng Sect]

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:11.170
[Tianyu Sect] [Qionghua Sect]

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:12.340
Found it.

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:17.450
Qionghua Sect: the oldest
demon-hunting sect.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:20.010
Residence: Mount Shu.

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:22.010
Weapon: Sword.

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:25.530
Combat level: Class One.

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:27.540
Ultimate technique:

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:28.770
a sword art called

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:30.770
the Threefold Supreme Sword Force.

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:34.510
So that means they're very powerful,
right?

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:36.250
What are we waiting for then?

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:37.340
Let's go! Hurry!

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:38.680
Let's go. Let's go.

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:44.460
This place is wonderful.

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.530
After spending some time
in the bustling human realm,

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:51.390
don't you feel less afraid
and resentful of humans?

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:52.350
Of course.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.100
If all our friends from Demons' Valley

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:57.450
could visit the human realm once,

00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:59.340
I bet none of them would want to go back.

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:00.200
Right, Luoluo?

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:01.310
Yes. That's right.

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:04.200
What did I just say?

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:06.540
That pastry

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.040
was really delicious.

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:09.710
All you think about is food.

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:12.560
How about we conjure up some more food?

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:17.060
My Lord.

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:19.900
Your energy has been unstable lately.

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:22.290
Are you still

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:24.210
thinking about Pingjiang Prefecture?

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:24.860
Get lost.

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:26.330
My Lord,

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:29.490
do you want me to roll horizontally,

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:30.900
vertically,

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.070
diagonally,

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:33.470
or on my back?

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:35.730
My Lord,

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:38.660
admitting the truth

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:39.590
isn't shameful.

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:41.620
If you're really worried

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:43.400
and troubled,

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:46.450
I can accompany you to Pingjiang.

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:48.820
I told you to...

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.040
Get lost.

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:51.050
I know.

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:53.420
My...

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:56.380
My Lord?

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:58.940
Didn't you tell me to get lost?

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:00.400
Why did you leave instead?

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:04.220
You've encountered danger?

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:10.750
You don't look like it.

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:15.420
The food here is too delicious.

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:16.900
Just tasting a bit of everything

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.620
made me too full to sleep.

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:20.660
So I need you to join me
for a walk, Demon Lord.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:21.580
Don't you know

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:24.530
this jade pendant is meant to
protect your life?

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:25.060
Exactly.

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:27.860
I was worried I might die from overeating.

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:29.580
Let's go.

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:30.420
Come on.

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:39.970
This street has a lot of delicious food,
fun activities,

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:40.970
and things to see.

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:44.620
Try a bite.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:48.970
Just one bite.

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:55.770
Isn't it good?

00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:58.250
Yes,

00:21:58.690 --> 00:21:59.620
it's delicious.

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:00.900
Here you go, sir.

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:02.340
Alright, thank you.

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:03.450
And that! Let's go.

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:08.860
Do I look scary?

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:09.620
You do.

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:12.020
You look like a demon.

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.690
[Masks]

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:15.970
Try one too.

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:22.900
So frightening.

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:26.240
When you don't smile,
you look just as frightening.

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:29.240
Your tea soup is here.

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:30.250
Thank you.

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:31.800
Please enjoy, both of you.

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.860
My Lord, please try the soup.

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:43.450
Take a sip.

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:47.840
How is it?

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:51.630
If you don't like it, just spit it out.

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:54.580
If you don't like it, just spit it out.

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.240
Not everyone can handle this.

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:04.260
You really don't like it?

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:06.180
I do.

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:08.490
If you stay here for a few more days,

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:10.690
I'll take you around to explore and eat,

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:13.380
and you'll find it extremely wonderful.

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:14.530
Then you

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:16.460
won't hate humans so much anymore.

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:21.460
Some grudges are hard to forget,

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:23.420
and some feelings

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:25.690
are hard to let go.

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.690
This time during the slaughter
of Demons' Valley,

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:30.340
we've made a great contribution.

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:31.270
That's right!

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:33.450
Those demon hunters
are completely unreliable.

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:34.820
They still have to count on
our Feiyu Guards.

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.070
Exactly.

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:39.970
Don't go.

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:41.350
Come on. Come on.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:43.970
You don't want wine but tea, right?

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:45.820
His Majesty gave you those uniforms

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:47.490
to protect the people,

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.450
not to bully them!

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:50.530
Who's this?

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:53.450
I just crushed Demons' Valley

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:55.580
and slayed a 1,000-year-old great demon.

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:57.120
If it weren't for me,

00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:59.490
everyone in Pingjiang

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:01.420
would have been eaten by demons already.

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:02.700
So impressive?

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:04.140
If you've got real skills,

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:05.050
why not have a duel with me?

00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:05.730
You want a duel?

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:06.390
Bring it on!

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:12.050
Missed.

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:12.780
She missed!

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:14.780
She missed! She missed!

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:34.290
It's just been a few days,

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:36.420
yet your skills have improved.

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:38.930
Still not convinced?

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:42.740
Heaven and earth without limits,

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:43.960
yin and yang...

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:50.460
Yin and yang, lend me your power.

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:53.830
Wind and clouds carry my command,

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.340
dragons and snakes transform to feathers.

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:57.660
Gods of thunder and lightning,

00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.010
heed my call!

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.670
Golden light naturally shines,
illuminating all heavens.

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:13.600
Fire!

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:19.870
Golden light naturally shines,
illuminating all heavens. Fire!

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.140
Hurry up...

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:23.050
Fire!

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:37.180
Wind! Wind! Wind!

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:39.730
Wind!

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:45.130
Run!

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:00.880
First fire, then wind.

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.730
[Pingjiang]

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:04.420
Do you have any common sense at all?

I want to sit over there

00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:37.930
to see the performance from that angle.

00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:40.180
That won't do.

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:42.840
Mr. Song has a long-term reservation
there.

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:46.870
We really can't, sir.

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.010
You're putting me in a difficult position.

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:52.010
I'm out of silver.

00:33:57.770 --> 00:33:58.970
Look, this is just...

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:00.750
Please come this way then!

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:01.530
Come on.

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:01.860
Let's go.

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:02.860
This way, please.

00:34:11.739 --> 00:34:14.699
Gentlemen, do you know any of our ladies?

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:16.380
This is our first time here.

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:17.900
As the saying goes, "first time strangers,
second time friends."

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:19.420
Why not ask all the girls to come out

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:20.820
so we can get acquainted?

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:23.170
Sure.

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:25.139
Ladies,

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:27.909
come out and meet
our distinguished guests.

00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:30.090
Hurry, ladies!

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:31.340
Hurry up!

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:36.980
This pressure feels so good.

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:38.219
Here,

00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:39.330
a reward.

00:34:39.449 --> 00:34:40.300
Have another one.

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:41.960
-Is it sweet, sir?
-Is it good?

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:43.530
I think

00:34:44.219 --> 00:34:46.040
those two seem to be female.

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:49.100
As long as they give us real silver,

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:51.370
who cares if they're male or female?

00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:52.610
Understood, sis.

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:56.130
Have another one.

00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:56.659
Alright.

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:00.800
So nice.

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:02.430
Bravo.

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:09.510
Xiao Yao, look!

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:12.660
I choose him.

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:14.300
Alright, alright.

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:15.170
Stop, stop!

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:16.440
Alright, alright.

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:18.620
Everyone.

00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:21.650
Recently, my home has been haunted
by evil spirits,

00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:22.780
causing me no peace.

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:26.420
I've invited many sorcerers over,
but none of them have been able to help.

00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:28.780
I've heard that the Demon Slayer
of the Feiyu Guards,

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:30.490
Master Bingzhu,

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:32.490
has a demon-slaying blade

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:33.770
of incredible power.

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:36.710
I wish to borrow that precious blade.

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:38.420
He must have lost his mind.

00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:40.750
He's an official from the imperial city,

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:42.490
who doesn't know his place.

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:43.370
Exactly.

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:46.400
How could a divine weapon
be lent out casually?

00:35:46.610 --> 00:35:47.260
Indeed.

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:47.970
Exactly.

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:01.820
I may be untalented,
but my family is rather wealthy.

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:03.080
This is just a deposit.

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:04.530
Whoever has the ability

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:06.380
to bring that precious blade here,

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:07.930
once I verify its authenticity,

00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:09.740
will be rewarded with a cartload of gold.

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:10.170
A cartload of gold?

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:10.860
I'll do it!

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:11.740
That's a cartload of gold!

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:12.800
A cartload of gold!

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:13.650
Let's go! Come on!

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:15.420
What kind of blade is it, worth this much?

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:16.300
Indeed.

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:18.970
Xiao Yao, will this work?

00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:23.780
In the human realm,
money is the greatest law.

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:24.970
Let's go.

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:25.740
I'm scared.

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:28.340
Every minute with pretty ladies
is priceless.

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:30.740
Sir, please don't waste
this precious time.

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:32.860
That's right. Enjoy yourself, sir.

00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:34.270
Have a wonderful time.

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:49.760
Please, sir, don't replace me.

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:51.700
If Madam finds out,
she'll surely punish me

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:53.160
and won't give me any food.

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:54.740
Please, sir!

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:56.610
Please don't replace me!

00:36:58.340 --> 00:36:58.970
Sir...

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:03.350
Get up.

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.820
I... I won't replace you.

00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:10.120
Sit down.

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:22.860
Well,

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:24.700
you just said

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:27.550
if you're replaced, you won't get food.

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:29.650
Haven't you eaten yet?

00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:32.050
No.

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:36.360
Come on, eat these.

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:39.530
May I?

00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:40.320
Of course.

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:42.300
Eating is the most important thing
in the world.

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:43.230
Go ahead and eat.

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:44.970
Thank you.

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:47.050
Try this too.

00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:47.980
It's delicious.

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:53.120
I

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:55.150
would like to learn some

00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:57.300
beauty secrets today.

00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:59.310
Tell me everything you know

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:01.420
right away.

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:07.170
Look, if you mix honey with milk

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:08.650
and apply it to your face daily,

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:09.700
within a month,

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:11.630
your face will be
as smooth as a peeled egg.

00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:12.590
Really?

00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:15.420
It's best to try using facial powder
before bed too.

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:17.050
What is this facial powder?

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:18.620
It's for washing your face.

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:21.120
Besides your face, to become beautiful,

00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:23.570
your temperament is also important.

00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:26.990
Dance is a way
to enhance your temperament.

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:28.260
I want to learn to dance!

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:29.440
For dancing,

00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:32.940
we'll start with flexibility training.

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:35.260
Up. Up. Up.

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:38.300
Sir, is your leg alright?

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:39.120
It's fine.

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:42.730
Sir, you truly have exceptional talent.

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:44.440
Really? Just like that?

00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:45.570
What else is there?

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:46.650
I want to learn more.

00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:47.540
Yes, there is.

00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:49.170
Call all of them over.

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:19.260
Demon.

00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:34.340
This quilt is so fragrant and soft.

00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:38.190
This is my first time
sleeping on such a soft bed.

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:40.530
Then cover yourself well

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:41.610
and sleep tight.

00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:43.350
And then

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:45.070
have a sweet dream.

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:48.420
When you wake up, you can continue eating.

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:49.880
Aren't you going to sleep?

00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:54.860
I... I'm not sleepy yet.

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:57.230
Then tell me a story.

00:39:58.650 --> 00:39:59.570
I...

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:02.010
I don't know how to tell stories.

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:08.100
How about I weave a grass figure for you?

00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:22.570
It's done.

00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:28.960
You're so skillful.

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:31.550
I'll keep this forever.

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:32.700
When I go back home,

00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:34.720
I'll give it to my little brother.

00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:36.660
If your brother likes it,

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:38.140
I'll make one for him too.

00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:44.150
You're the best person

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:45.400
I've ever met.

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:53.060
My Lord, you're back.

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:56.500
You must be exhausted working so late.

00:40:56.700 --> 00:41:00.050
My wife has prepared
a table of fine food and wine.

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:01.450
We've been waiting for your return,
My Lord,

00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:04.130
so you can enjoy a good meal
and relieve your fatigue.

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:05.060
My Lord, please.

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:16.530
My Lord,

00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:19.830
please take the seat of honor.

00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:23.860
Mr. Ji.

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:26.300
It's me.

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:29.140
You? How did you get in?

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:30.530
That's not important.

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:31.050
My Lord,

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:32.220
I have some

00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:34.570
wonderful news to share with you.

00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:39.130
Prefect Liu, you've got something
to discuss with me?

00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:40.300
It's nothing special.

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:42.570
Just treating you to a simple meal,
My Lord.

00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:43.660
I wonder if the food

00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:45.340
suits your taste, My Lord.

00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:48.490
You might as well speak frankly.

00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:54.820
My mother is over 70 years old now.

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:56.420
She lives in the countryside

00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:58.340
and was originally in good health.

00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:01.200
But recently, she's contracted
a strange illness.

00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:03.010
I've consulted many famous doctors,

00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:03.940
but nothing has helped.

00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:05.870
She shows no signs of improvement.

00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:09.120
A sorcerer said she might be possessed.

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:10.690
So I was wondering

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:14.140
if I could borrow your precious blade
for a while, My Lord,

00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:17.020
to hang it in my home

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:18.910
and drive away evil spirits.

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:27.050
My mother is very elderly.

00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:29.010
I truly have no other options.

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:31.610
That's why I've put aside my pride
to ask for your help.

00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:33.300
Please grant my request, My Lord.

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:34.300
Tell me the truth.

00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:36.610
This is the truth.

00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:41.710
Demon Slayer! I've got important matters
to report in person.

00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:43.890
Demon Slayer!

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:56.480
My Lord, I have urgent matters to report.

00:42:56.650 --> 00:42:57.300
What is it?

00:42:57.780 --> 00:42:59.310
May I have a word in private?

00:43:03.490 --> 00:43:04.940
Prefect Liu is one of us.

00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:07.350
Just say it here.

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:08.780
Sit.

00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:15.630
You sit too.

00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:20.780
Go ahead.

00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:27.530
My Lord.

00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:30.690
I have a presumptuous request, My Lord.

00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:34.190
I just received a message from home

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:37.820
that my father has been
possessed by evil spirits,

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:40.900
and ordinary medical treatments
have all been ineffective.

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:43.610
Only a pure yang treasure

00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:45.860
can drive away the evil spirits.

00:43:46.650 --> 00:43:47.340
My Lord.

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:49.170
My father raised me to success,

00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:51.030
spending all our family fortune.

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:53.050
I have no way to repay him.

00:43:54.450 --> 00:43:56.450
-So no matter I...
-So you want to use my blade

00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:58.710
to ward off evil spirits for your father?

00:43:59.130 --> 00:44:00.380
That's right. That's right.

00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:01.820
You're so perceptive, My Lord.

00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:02.740
I'll just borrow it for one night

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:04.540
and return it tomorrow morning.

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:07.080
Please grant my request, My Lord.

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:19.560
I'd like to thank you
on behalf of my father, My Lord!

00:44:21.490 --> 00:44:22.050
Sit.

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:30.300
What a coincidence.

00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:33.410
Commander Ji's father

00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:35.940
needs my blade to drive away evil spirits.

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:37.130
Right.

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:40.940
Prefect Liu's mother

00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:42.680
needs my blade

00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:44.380
to protect their house.

00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:48.340
It seems those demons

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:51.570
have used quite a lot of tricks
on you lately, huh?

00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:52.030
Indeed.

00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:53.300
I have a better idea.

00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:57.260
I'll first visit your mother

00:44:57.820 --> 00:44:59.110
and then your father.

00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:01.830
If there are really demons at work,

00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:04.330
I'll use this blade to slay them.

00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:06.010
Wouldn't that be better?

00:45:06.010 --> 00:45:06.650
No, no, no.

00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:08.260
Save his father first.

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:09.490
My mother's condition isn't urgent.

00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:10.420
When do we leave?

00:45:11.090 --> 00:45:12.050
First come, first served.

00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:13.130
First come, first served.

00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:13.650
No, no, no.

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:14.740
Save his father first.

00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:15.830
-No, no, no.
-My mother's condition is not serious.

00:45:15.830 --> 00:45:16.300
No, no, no.

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:17.130
Save his mother first.

00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:17.740
Save his father first.

00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:19.400
What exactly is going on here!

00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:24.090
My Lord.

00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:26.250
Someone wants

00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:29.840
to borrow your precious blade
to ward off evil spirits.

00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:31.080
Who?

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:32.530
I don't know his name,

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:34.650
but he seems like a spoiled rich child,

00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:35.570
spending money like water.

00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:37.420
He appears to be from the capital.

00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:38.780
He's offering a reward in Pingjiang,

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:39.220
saying

00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:41.300
whoever can get your precious blade
for him

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:43.560
will be rewarded with a cartload of gold.

00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:44.670
A cartload of gold?

00:45:45.730 --> 00:45:46.690
No one told you?

00:45:54.610 --> 00:45:56.040
I never thought my blade

00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:57.970
would be worth so much.

00:45:59.650 --> 00:46:01.050
So where is this rich guy?

00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:02.800
Take me to meet him.

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:09.900
This is my family heirloom blade.

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:10.900
Check it out. It's identical.

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:12.220
-What blade?
-What kind of junk is this?

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:14.010
-You scammer!
-It's my family heirloom.

00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:14.970
Give your blade to me!

00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:15.820
To hell with your blade!

00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:16.750
Get out of my way!

00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:17.610
Where did this scammer come from?

00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:18.570
Exactly.

00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:19.050
Who does he think he's fooling?

00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:20.170
You nasty woman, just you wait!

00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:20.700
Get lost!

00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:24.570
And what's your business here?

00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:25.260
Offering a blade.
