00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:46.239
Sir

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:48.079
Just as you predicted

00:01:48.519 --> 00:01:49.640
In the end, Grand Preceptor Meng

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.000
will investigate the matter in the three southeastern provinces.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.560
Grand Preceptor is utterly loyal

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.560
and has long held prestige.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.799
Moreover, he only ever takes orders from His Majesty.

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:58.519
If we assist him covertly,

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:59.760
he's sure to uncover something.

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:03.959
Sir, what is it?

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:07.599
The Fifth Princess is probably not that simple.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.080
So, sir, you mean...

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:15.120
We must find an opportunity

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.800
to properly meet the Fifth Princess.

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:33.439
Guess who I am.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.240
Eunuch Xue?

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.000
What a dummy.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.240
A Lan is not a dummy.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.039
Little dummy.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.719
Seventh Cousin!

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.800
A Lan has a temper too!

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:50.599
Then let me see

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.360
what kind of temper a little dummy can have.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.680
Mosquito!

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.240
Who are you trying to fool?

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.000
Where's the mosquito?

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:03.800
It flew away.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.439
You... I...

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:06.319
Seventh Cousin!

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:07.520
Why are you arguing with her?

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:09.919
The little dummy keeps bullying me.

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:11.639
My face must be swollen.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.840
If it weren't for

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.759
you begging the miracle doctor to treat Consort Shu,

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.680
Don't worry.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.199
Your face isn't swollen.

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.759
See?

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:33.800
See this dutiful pawn of mine?

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.319
Princess,

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.240
why are you suddenly looking for Xiao Lizi?

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.039
I need him for something.

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:48.960
Have him stay in Yunxi Palace today.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.759
He's not allowed to go anywhere.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.159
Your servant pays respects to the Fifth Princess.

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:59.439
Xiao Lizi.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.039
You stay here in Yunxi Palace today.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.719
Don't go out.

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.759
But Eunuch Xue also ordered me

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:05.520
to go to the Library Pavilion at the hour of the Goat today.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.639
You don't need to go.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.560
If anyone asks,

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.159
say it's the Fifth Princess's order.

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.800
How has the Fifth Princess been lately?

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:19.560
Ever since you arrived,

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.000
not so well.

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:43.279
Don't go!

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.160
Why can't he leave?

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.160
A Lan wants him to play with A Lan.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.360
I'll play with you today.

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:05.720
A Lan will go find Xi Xi.

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:06.800
Fifth Princess.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.160
Does the Fifth Princess know

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:14.680
that a single leaf,

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:16.480
from a hundred paces away,

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.839
can not only cut a flagpole

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.720
but also take a person's head?

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.360
Eldest Cousin is so amazing!

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.560
Eldest Cousin, A Lan wants to go to the Library Pavilion.

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:59.639
What for?

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.079
To read.

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:07.879
We'll go once we catch a fish.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.480
You're ruthless.

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:41.120
But Eunuch Xue also ordered me

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.759
to go to the Library Pavilion at the hour of the Goat today.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.759
Fifth Princess,

00:07:19.519 --> 00:07:20.680
where are you going?

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:22.439
We caught a fish.

00:07:28.959 --> 00:07:30.680
Eldest Cousin is sleeping.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.920
The bugs in the tree are noisy.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.959
A Lan will help Eldest Cousin chase the bugs away.

00:08:06.519 --> 00:08:07.279
It's broken.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.240
Eldest Cousin...

00:08:10.079 --> 00:08:11.240
We can't fish anymore.

00:08:11.879 --> 00:08:12.879
Go read your book.

00:08:25.199 --> 00:08:26.800
I didn't steal! I didn't steal!

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:40.679
Fifth Princess!

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:41.440
Eldest Cousin!

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:44.120
This... he's about to die.

00:08:55.639 --> 00:08:56.919
Your humble servant pays respects to the Fifth Princess.

00:08:57.519 --> 00:08:58.120
Xiao Lizi!

00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:00.279
Xiao Lizi!

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.159
I pay respects to the Chief Grand Secretary.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:06.559
Princess,

00:09:06.799 --> 00:09:07.279
what is this?

00:09:08.919 --> 00:09:09.919
He's injured.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.399
He needs to see a doctor.

00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:12.279
Yes, Princess.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.919
This servant will take him to see a physician right away.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000
What are you still standing around for?

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:17.919
Quickly, help him up

00:09:17.919 --> 00:09:18.759
and take him to the Imperial Hospital.

00:09:19.039 --> 00:09:19.600
Fifth Princess,

00:09:19.799 --> 00:09:20.639
I'm afraid that's not appropriate.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.360
This servant stole Consort Yu's jewelry.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.960
Consort Yu ordered fifty strokes with the rod.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.799
There are still over twenty strokes left.

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:26.840
What?

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.720
Now you won't even listen to the Fifth Princess's words?

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.279
Shall we invite His Majesty over?

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:39.639
Fifth Princess,

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.639
weren't you just saying you wanted to read?

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.960
The Fifth Princess is truly different from before.

00:10:11.039 --> 00:10:12.639
To actually save a little eunuch.

00:10:14.679 --> 00:10:16.559
It was Eldest Cousin who saved him.

00:10:18.679 --> 00:10:20.279
I just felt sorry for him, that's all.

00:10:21.159 --> 00:10:22.519
And why did the Fifth Princess...?

00:10:24.759 --> 00:10:27.000
A Lan must do more good deeds.

00:10:27.559 --> 00:10:30.000
Then Eldest Cousin won't dislike A Lan.

00:10:32.159 --> 00:10:33.879
I heard that after you kicked Consort Yu into the water,

00:10:33.879 --> 00:10:34.960
she fell seriously ill.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.799
Shouldn't the Fifth Princess go see her?

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.360
Go see Consort Yu?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:44.519
Wait.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.399
How can you visit the sick without a gift?

00:10:59.039 --> 00:11:00.879
This item can help Consort Yu recover quickly.

00:11:01.919 --> 00:11:03.559
Give this to Consort Yu,

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.960
and say it's a gift you prepared yourself.

00:11:06.519 --> 00:11:06.960
How is it?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:10.679
Ugly.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.399
Ugly or not isn't important.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.480
As long as it's useful.

00:11:24.159 --> 00:11:25.679
Consort Yu's quarters aren't far from here.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.480
Eldest Cousin will escort you.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.039
It's really useful?

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.200
Whether it's useful or not,

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.840
you'll know once you try it.

00:11:45.919 --> 00:11:47.519
Then A Lan will try it.

00:12:11.039 --> 00:12:12.440
If A Lan recovers,

00:12:12.679 --> 00:12:13.519
then it's useful.

00:12:13.879 --> 00:12:15.840
If it's useful, make one to give to Consort Yu.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:16.840
Eldest Cousin,

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.360
don't you think A Lan is very clever?

00:12:24.879 --> 00:12:25.320
Princess

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.200
The imperial physician said

00:12:26.279 --> 00:12:27.480
Xiao Lizi is not seriously hurt.

00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:31.519
Eldest Cousin

00:12:31.879 --> 00:12:32.840
A Lan is hungry.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.120
I want to go back and eat grapes.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:36.519
Princess

00:12:36.879 --> 00:12:38.960
You and Lord Yuwen wait here a moment.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.039
This servant will go prepare.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:52.480
Princess

00:12:52.759 --> 00:12:54.480
You and Lord Yuwen chat slowly.

00:13:29.279 --> 00:13:29.840
Fifth Princess

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.879
It tastes better this way.

00:13:36.519 --> 00:13:38.840
What did Eldest Cousin add?

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.399
Top-grade powdered sugar.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:41.879
Have a taste.

00:13:54.279 --> 00:13:56.200
Eldest Cousin likes to eat it this way.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.399
Eldest Cousin likes it.

00:14:11.639 --> 00:14:12.799
For Eldest Cousin to eat.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:16.600
It fell.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.399
Then I'll give all these to Eldest Cousin.

00:14:21.759 --> 00:14:23.080
A Lan will eat pastries.

00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:34.039
Eldest Cousin

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.279
Why aren't you eating?

00:14:35.919 --> 00:14:36.600
No appetite.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.360
Eldest Cousin has no appetite.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.759
Then A Lan won't eat either.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:46.960
Attendants!

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:51.519
Take it all away.

00:14:55.559 --> 00:14:56.039
Yes.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.080
A rat!

00:15:07.639 --> 00:15:08.120
A rat!

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:08.759
Where's the rat?

00:15:13.759 --> 00:15:14.799
Where is the rat?

00:15:26.639 --> 00:15:28.919
Could Yuwen Rui have already noticed?

00:15:30.639 --> 00:15:31.440
Friendly reminder:

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.200
Xiao Lizi has come back to life.

00:15:34.399 --> 00:15:35.639
But Nanny Mo from the Cold Palace

00:15:35.799 --> 00:15:37.399
is still waiting for you to save her.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:46.759
Princess

00:15:47.039 --> 00:15:48.759
Recently, Lord Yuwen has been visiting you often.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.159
Your wedding will probably be held soon.

00:15:52.519 --> 00:15:53.320
In this servant's opinion,

00:15:53.679 --> 00:15:54.679
this time next year,

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.240
Princess should also have a child.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.799
This servant should also be busy.

00:15:58.559 --> 00:16:00.799
I wonder what Little Lord Yuwen's temperament will be like.

00:16:00.799 --> 00:16:02.919
Will he be like the Princess or like Lord Yuwen?

00:16:03.399 --> 00:16:04.960
Will he like this servant?

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:07.919
It's also worrisome.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.000
But it's okay.

00:16:10.559 --> 00:16:11.759
Little Lord Yuwen

00:16:11.759 --> 00:16:13.440
surely won't be harder to serve than the Princess.

00:16:15.039 --> 00:16:16.720
But after the Princess lost her memory,

00:16:16.919 --> 00:16:18.480
her temperament has changed quite a bit.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.000
Princess

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.039
Wait for this servant.

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:23.919
My lord.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.039
The Fifth Princess, is she truly foolish?

00:16:27.879 --> 00:16:28.360
No.

00:16:28.799 --> 00:16:30.039
She is very clever.

00:16:33.039 --> 00:16:33.480
Princess

00:16:33.799 --> 00:16:35.559
You and Lord Yuwen chat slowly.

00:16:43.759 --> 00:16:44.679
You mean to say

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.039
the Fifth Princess didn't know

00:16:46.039 --> 00:16:47.399
what was placed in the grapes wasn't poison.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.080
And she worried that maid

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.639
would steal and eat them again after they were taken away.

00:16:51.679 --> 00:16:53.240
That's why she deliberately said she saw a rat

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.240
and knocked over the grapes.

00:16:57.639 --> 00:16:58.600
So it seems

00:16:59.039 --> 00:17:00.159
this Fifth Princess's mind

00:17:00.159 --> 00:17:01.320
is as deep as yours, my lord.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:03.120
Meticulous.

00:17:03.679 --> 00:17:04.599
Extremely meticulous.

00:17:10.759 --> 00:17:12.079
There's still plenty of time.

00:17:12.279 --> 00:17:13.160
No need to worry too much.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.720
It's not you who's trapped in the script.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:15.720
Of course you're not worried.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.160
Don't be so angry.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.279
Let me tell you a secret.

00:17:19.559 --> 00:17:20.920
Nanny Mo will become

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.200
your perfect partner and brain trust.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:25.799
Nanny Mo

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.960
Could she be a powerful figure hidden in the palace?

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.039
Is Nanny Mo powerful or not?

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.640
You'll find out soon enough.

00:18:06.839 --> 00:18:09.119
True masters often appear as humble janitors.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.039
Nanny Mo must be a powerful figure.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.359
Nanny Mo

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.079
Were you sent by His Highness the Third Prince?

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.960
His Highness the Third Prince

00:18:37.279 --> 00:18:38.559
You want to harm His Highness the Third Prince!

00:18:38.759 --> 00:18:40.079
I'll beat you to death!

00:18:40.079 --> 00:18:41.519
Nanny Mo, I... I'll beat you to death!

00:18:41.519 --> 00:18:42.079
Nanny Mo

00:18:43.279 --> 00:18:44.720
Nanny Mo, you mustn't harm His Highness the Third Prince!

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:45.839
Calm down, Princess.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.359
You, nanny!

00:18:48.519 --> 00:18:49.079
Do you have a death wish?!

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.160
His Highness the Third Prince!

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.680
Have you seen our His Highness the Third Prince?

00:18:55.759 --> 00:18:56.559
Your Highness!

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.799
Who has seen our His Highness?

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.119
Her!

00:19:00.519 --> 00:19:00.960
Your Highness!

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.160
It couldn't be Nanny Mo, could it?

00:19:02.519 --> 00:19:03.519
Where are you?

00:19:03.799 --> 00:19:04.960
She's insane.

00:19:05.359 --> 00:19:06.400
Holds a pillow all day.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.240
Where are you?

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.640
I hear your voice.

00:19:10.119 --> 00:19:12.480
Third Prince... His Highness the Third Prince!

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.480
This old servant has come to save you, Your Highness!

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:16.240
Nanny! Nanny! Nanny!

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:17.519
Don't!

00:19:17.559 --> 00:19:18.240
Let go of me!

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:18.920
Calm down!

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.640
How is this nanny so strong?

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.640
You let go of me!

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:23.559
Let go of me!

00:19:24.359 --> 00:19:24.799
Your Highness!

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.680
This old servant has come to save you, Your Highness!

00:19:26.839 --> 00:19:27.920
The Third Prince is over there!

00:19:32.759 --> 00:19:34.079
His Highness the Third Prince!

00:19:35.319 --> 00:19:36.279
His Highness the Third Prince!

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.200
His Highness the Third Prince!

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:41.400
Your Highness! Princess!

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.319
Your Highness!

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.640
Your Highness, where did you go? Your Highness!

00:19:54.319 --> 00:19:55.359
Nanny Mo will become

00:19:55.359 --> 00:19:57.839
your perfect partner and brain trust.

00:20:00.279 --> 00:20:01.319
Princess, are you alright?

00:20:03.519 --> 00:20:04.440
I'm perfectly fine.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:07.599
You go back first.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:08.440
But...

00:20:09.039 --> 00:20:10.319
I want to be alone for a while.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:14.400
Yes.

00:20:36.039 --> 00:20:37.559
Perfect partner

00:20:38.559 --> 00:20:39.720
Brain trust

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:42.319
Plot Spirit

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.200
Come out and chat for a bit.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.039
If you're so capable, never show up again.

00:20:50.559 --> 00:20:51.559
If I don't appear,

00:20:53.119 --> 00:20:54.119
who will give you your missions?

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.920
How will you return to the real world?

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:58.559
Who are you?

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:02.839
Nanny Mo can see you?

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.119
I am the Plot Spirit.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.599
Of course I can let whoever I want see me.

00:21:08.839 --> 00:21:11.599
Besides, this Plot Spirit is handsome and dashing.

00:21:13.119 --> 00:21:14.160
Ugly man.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.880
Wearing red clothes.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.880
Third Prince, Your Highness.

00:21:18.359 --> 00:21:19.759
Don't you learn from him.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.680
Nanny Mo's taste is still on point.

00:21:28.279 --> 00:21:29.799
This Plot Spirit won't argue with you.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.039
Alright.

00:21:33.519 --> 00:21:34.519
Explain it.

00:21:35.319 --> 00:21:37.519
How did Nanny Mo become my perfect partner

00:21:37.759 --> 00:21:38.480
and brain trust?

00:21:40.039 --> 00:21:41.079
You and Nanny Mo,

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.039
one's crazy, one's foolish.

00:21:43.799 --> 00:21:45.160
Isn't that the perfect partnership?

00:21:46.119 --> 00:21:46.519
You!

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.319
As for the brain trust,

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.119
you'll learn Nanny Mo's usefulness later.

00:21:55.039 --> 00:21:55.559
Bye-bye.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:18.359
Xi Xi.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.799
Who is the Third Prince Nanny Mo mentioned?

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.720
He was the Third Prince of Yunze.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.359
Over ten years ago,

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.440
Yunze's young Third Prince was sent to Yunmi

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:31.519
to become a hostage prince.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:32.599
He lived in Xicui Palace.

00:22:34.279 --> 00:22:36.359
This servant heard from an old palace nanny

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.119
that the year Yunze fell,

00:22:38.319 --> 00:22:39.400
Xicui Palace caught fire.

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.880
The hostage prince perished in the flames.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.119
Is it possible the hostage prince didn't die?

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.319
The prince's remains were found back then.

00:22:49.039 --> 00:22:51.680
Nanny Mo was the wet nurse for that Yunze hostage prince.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.559
She accompanied the prince to Yunmi.

00:22:56.119 --> 00:22:57.160
After the prince died,

00:22:57.559 --> 00:22:59.000
the nanny became deranged.

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.079
She mistakes everyone for the Third Prince.

00:23:04.319 --> 00:23:06.440
From now on, have people take good care of her.

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.599
Don't let her freeze or starve in the Cold Palace.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.359
Such tiny shoes.

00:23:15.079 --> 00:23:16.000
Who are you making them for?

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.720
Naturally, for the child of the Princess and Lord Yuwen.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.160
Since Lord Yuwen has fallen for the Princess,

00:23:27.559 --> 00:23:29.720
these things must be prepared in advance.

00:23:31.799 --> 00:23:32.960
What does Yuwen Rui like about me?

00:23:33.839 --> 00:23:34.720
Does he like my foolishness?

00:23:35.359 --> 00:23:36.240
My dullness?

00:23:36.799 --> 00:23:37.960
Or my viciousness?

00:23:38.799 --> 00:23:40.640
How can Your Highness speak of yourself like that?

00:23:41.319 --> 00:23:42.160
Lord Yuwen

00:23:42.319 --> 00:23:44.559
must see past the Princess's foolish facade

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:47.880
to the kindness deep in your heart.

00:23:49.759 --> 00:23:51.440
The Princess likes the Lord,

00:23:53.599 --> 00:23:55.359
and the Lord likes the Princess.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.200
It's truly heaven's will.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.519
What a joyous occasion!

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.920
This servant has already ordered the Imperial Wardrobe

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.480
to prepare the Princess's wedding gown.

00:24:14.839 --> 00:24:16.279
The three southeastern provinces are now a vast sea.

00:24:17.759 --> 00:24:18.799
Who told this emperor

00:24:19.839 --> 00:24:21.119
the floods were controlled

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.119
and the people were rebuilding their homes?

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.720
Ten million taels in relief funds...

00:24:26.079 --> 00:24:27.319
Why, when they reached the three southeastern provinces,

00:24:27.519 --> 00:24:28.920
were only three million taels left?

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:30.680
Calm your anger, Imperial Brother.

00:24:31.079 --> 00:24:32.400
Your subject brother deserves death ten thousand times.

00:24:33.559 --> 00:24:36.519
I entrusted this matter entirely to Minister Zhang.

00:24:37.519 --> 00:24:38.400
Imperial Brother, you know

00:24:38.759 --> 00:24:40.079
he is my prized student.

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.079
I was selfish.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.359
I wanted him to earn merit.

00:24:43.799 --> 00:24:44.319
Who would have thought

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:45.799
he was of corrupt character,

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.279
daring to deceive me,

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.119
and using my name

00:24:49.319 --> 00:24:50.559
to collude with local officials

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.440
and embezzle the relief silver.

00:24:53.759 --> 00:24:54.880
Due to my fault,

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.319
the local people suffered.

00:24:58.079 --> 00:25:00.480
I beg Imperial Brother to punish me severely.

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:01.960
This emperor will punish severely.

00:25:03.519 --> 00:25:03.920
Guards!

00:25:04.559 --> 00:25:05.279
Summon Zhang Bo to the palace.

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:06.119
Yes.

00:25:15.559 --> 00:25:17.359
You're quite leisurely.

00:25:17.799 --> 00:25:18.599
Can't be helped.

00:25:19.359 --> 00:25:21.000
One must live joyfully.

00:25:22.079 --> 00:25:23.240
Since you're so idle,

00:25:23.799 --> 00:25:25.279
I'll issue you

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.079
your next mission early.

00:25:27.319 --> 00:25:30.519
It's not saving some lunatic or fool again, is it?

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.599
Aren't there enough fools and lunatics in this palace?

00:25:35.799 --> 00:25:39.319
This time, the pawn to save is He Lianchen.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.519
He Lianchen, Commander of the Imperial Guard.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.160
He Lianchen will die at Luo Jie River in ten days.

00:25:53.519 --> 00:25:54.119
Good luck.

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.480
Who would want to kill the Imperial Guard Commander?

00:26:07.079 --> 00:26:07.519
Princess.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:08.839
This servant went to see Xiao Lizi.

00:26:08.839 --> 00:26:10.200
He has mostly recovered.

00:26:10.359 --> 00:26:12.680
He told me the whole story.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.039
Xiao Lizi has a foster mother outside the palace.

00:26:16.279 --> 00:26:17.119
She's been ill for years.

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.079
To treat his foster mother,

00:26:19.599 --> 00:26:21.799
Xiao Lizi has been secretly selling information in the palace.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.440
If a palace master wants to inquire about something,

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:25.440
they all go to him.

00:26:26.559 --> 00:26:28.160
The palace's know-it-all.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.640
Consort Yu wanted him for this reason,

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.279
to take Xiao Lizi for her own use.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.480
But Xiao Lizi is principled.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.720
He refused to serve Consort Yu.

00:26:36.039 --> 00:26:37.119
This angered Consort Yu.

00:26:37.759 --> 00:26:38.920
Consort Yu wanted to punish him,

00:26:39.079 --> 00:26:41.839
so she framed him for stealing jewelry.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.279
I knew it.

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.160
Consort Yu is no good person.

00:26:47.039 --> 00:26:48.960
This servant also asked Xiao Lizi for many favors.

00:26:49.599 --> 00:26:51.200
I didn't expect he'd offended Consort Yu.

00:26:51.559 --> 00:26:52.359
How pitiful.

00:26:55.279 --> 00:26:57.640
Don't you think our Yunxi Palace

00:26:58.119 --> 00:26:59.319
is precisely lacking someone

00:26:59.319 --> 00:27:01.160
with talents like Xiao Lizi?

00:27:01.839 --> 00:27:03.240
Your Highness means...

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.440
Once he comes to Yunxi Palace,

00:27:06.519 --> 00:27:07.519
he becomes my person.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.599
Let's see if Consort Yu dares touch him again.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.200
Your servant pays respects to the Fifth Princess.

00:27:26.559 --> 00:27:27.279
Xiao Lizi.

00:27:27.759 --> 00:27:29.160
The princess is in a good mood today.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.759
She has decided to do a good deed.

00:27:31.519 --> 00:27:33.759
This is enough for your foster mother's treatment.

00:27:34.119 --> 00:27:35.359
And to live comfortably for the rest of her life.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:37.799
Really.

00:27:38.519 --> 00:27:38.960
Your servant...

00:27:39.359 --> 00:27:41.200
Your servant thanks the Fifth Princess for her great kindness.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.640
Don't be so quick to rejoice.

00:27:44.319 --> 00:27:45.000
The princess says

00:27:45.599 --> 00:27:47.039
if you want to take this gold,

00:27:47.319 --> 00:27:48.359
there is a condition.

00:27:49.039 --> 00:27:49.839
What condition?

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.440
You may stay in the Fifth Princess's palace from now on,

00:27:58.279 --> 00:27:59.720
but you must drink this wine.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:01.880
Xiao Lizi.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.480
If you drink this wine,

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.200
you will never be able to speak again.

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:08.759
This...

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:18.279
Your servant...

00:28:19.119 --> 00:28:20.319
Your servant thanks the Fifth Princess.

00:28:37.799 --> 00:28:38.319
Congratulations.

00:28:38.599 --> 00:28:39.519
Welcome to my team.

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:46.480
Fifth Princess...

00:28:47.119 --> 00:28:47.519
You...

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.119
This... this wine...

00:28:51.319 --> 00:28:52.039
Peach blossom wine.

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:52.839
Tasty, isn't it?

00:29:02.559 --> 00:29:03.000
My lord.

00:29:04.039 --> 00:29:05.640
His Majesty summoned Lord Zhang to the palace today.

00:29:06.119 --> 00:29:06.920
Lord Zhang has admitted

00:29:07.359 --> 00:29:08.720
to concealing the floods in the three southeastern provinces

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:09.960
and embezzling the disaster relief funds.

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.079
He claims it was his own doing,

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.319
and that Prince Ning was unaware.

00:29:14.119 --> 00:29:17.119
It seems we cannot topple Prince Ning this time.

00:29:17.759 --> 00:29:19.279
Toppling Prince Ning is not that simple.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.400
His Majesty has always trusted him implicitly.

00:29:23.359 --> 00:29:24.279
After this incident,

00:29:24.519 --> 00:29:26.480
it's good to plant a seed of doubt in His Majesty's mind.

00:29:30.119 --> 00:29:30.519
My lord.

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.039
Didn't you say before

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.240
the Fifth Princess discovered the prayer matter?

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.279
Are we just going to leave her be?

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:38.200
Don't worry.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:39.720
I have my own method

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:42.039
to ensure she dares not utter a single word.

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.680
This smells so good!

00:29:46.039 --> 00:29:47.839
Princess, you are so clever!

00:29:49.039 --> 00:29:49.920
Wait, wait, wait!

00:29:50.519 --> 00:29:51.279
It smells wonderful!

00:29:53.039 --> 00:29:53.519
Princess,

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:54.279
can we eat it now?

00:29:54.279 --> 00:29:55.200
Can we eat it now, Princess?

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:07.839
Delicious, right?

00:30:07.839 --> 00:30:09.279
It's so delicious, Princess!

00:30:09.279 --> 00:30:09.759
So good!

00:30:11.839 --> 00:30:12.799
This one's ready, this one.

00:30:12.799 --> 00:30:13.359
By the way, Princess,

00:30:15.839 --> 00:30:16.720
as you instructed,

00:30:17.079 --> 00:30:19.000
your servant has investigated Commander He's daily schedule,

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.319
what he usually likes to do,

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:21.440
and who he has feuded with.

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:22.960
I've looked into it all.

00:30:25.839 --> 00:30:26.279
Princess,

00:30:27.079 --> 00:30:28.599
why are you investigating Commander He?

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.799
I have my own reasons, naturally.

00:30:35.279 --> 00:30:38.079
He Lianchen, one of the Four Young Masters of Yunmi!

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:41.359
Loyal and righteous, shaking the realm!

00:30:42.119 --> 00:30:43.720
This is a cheering slogan.

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:44.799
Cheering?

00:30:45.119 --> 00:30:46.559
What's 'cheering,' Princess?

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:48.400
It's nothing.

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.200
Your servant's investigation found that

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:52.279
five years ago,

00:30:52.559 --> 00:30:53.960
Commander He and Lord Yuwen

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.160
fought side by side on the battlefield.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.119
Their relationship was quite good.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.319
But later,

00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.400
their stances differed,

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:00.480
and their political views clashed.

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:01.960
Gradually, they became like strangers.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.319
It's lonely at the top.

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:06.359
My lord is truly pitiable.

00:31:10.279 --> 00:31:10.759
Fragrant!

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.720
You should pity your own princess instead.

00:31:14.359 --> 00:31:14.839
Princess!

00:31:14.839 --> 00:31:15.839
It's too delicious!

00:31:49.359 --> 00:31:49.839
Who's there?

00:32:08.759 --> 00:32:09.240
My lord.

00:32:09.519 --> 00:32:10.720
There is a result regarding Prince Ning's matter.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.440
The Emperor has ordered a fine of three years' salary.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.240
Lord Zhang is to be exiled in three days.

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.799
I already know the route he will take when leaving the capital.

00:32:17.319 --> 00:32:18.079
Everything is arranged.

00:32:18.599 --> 00:32:19.240
Rest assured, my lord.

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:20.839
Everything has been properly arranged.

00:32:24.839 --> 00:32:25.960
Have someone send a message to the Fifth Princess.

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:27.519
In three days,

00:32:29.119 --> 00:32:30.359
take her out of the palace for an excursion.

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:33.039
An excursion out of the palace?

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.799
What exactly is Yuwen Rui's intention?

00:32:36.599 --> 00:32:39.079
Naturally, it's to properly nurture feelings with you!

00:32:39.799 --> 00:32:40.759
For so many years,

00:32:41.079 --> 00:32:43.279
when has Lord Yuwen ever been

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.599
so attentive to any woman?

00:32:44.839 --> 00:32:45.640
Xixi is right.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.559
My lord must be captivated by the princess's uniqueness.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.119
Moreover, I've noticed

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:53.319
when Lord Yuwen looks at the princess,

00:32:53.599 --> 00:32:55.559
his eyes are full of affection.

00:32:56.519 --> 00:32:57.680
That's hatred.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.880
Shippers really rely entirely on imagination.

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:03.880
An excursion out of the palace...

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.079
What clothes should we prepare for the princess?

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:10.039
Will the princess return to the palace or to the Yuwen residence that night?

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.519
This is really worrying.

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:30.079
I have sent people to make arrangements along the route.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:31.680
For this journey,

00:33:32.759 --> 00:33:33.680
you have worked hard.

00:33:35.519 --> 00:33:36.440
Serving Your Highness

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.119
is this subordinate's honor.

00:33:38.599 --> 00:33:39.799
How can I speak of hardship?

00:33:43.839 --> 00:33:45.720
If you had not taken on all the blame,

00:33:47.119 --> 00:33:50.799
the one in the prison cell would likely be me.

00:33:52.079 --> 00:33:52.680
Rest assured,

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.119
once an opportunity arises,

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.640
I will definitely find a way for you to return to the capital.

00:33:59.079 --> 00:33:59.839
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:34:02.119 --> 00:34:02.799
Between you and me,

00:34:04.119 --> 00:34:04.799
there is no need for formalities.

00:34:06.559 --> 00:34:07.319
When you return,

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.559
I will prepare another banquet

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:12.360
to welcome you back.

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:14.280
Here.

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:32.079
Princess

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.960
I've exhausted all my efforts these past two days

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.079
to inquire about Lord Yuwen's preferences.

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.559
If you master these preferences,

00:34:39.039 --> 00:34:40.679
you're sure to get along with Lord Yuwen

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.199
and live happily together.

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:42.599
Right!

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:45.199
Living happily together is impossible.

00:34:46.039 --> 00:34:47.719
The probability of mutual destruction is quite high.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:49.320
Princess,

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:50.599
everything prepared here

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.440
is what Lord Yuwen loves to eat.

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:53.639
Xiao Lizi,

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.199
you've done well.

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:57.360
After all, you saved my life, Princess.

00:34:57.719 --> 00:34:59.320
Naturally, I must try every possible way

00:34:59.599 --> 00:35:01.320
to fulfill all your wishes.

00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:05.480
You rank number...

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:06.519
two

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:07.840
Second place

00:35:08.199 --> 00:35:09.079
on my list of benefactors.

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:10.119
Who's first?

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.840
Grand Preceptor Meng.

00:35:12.119 --> 00:35:13.559
Back then, I had just entered the palace

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.679
and accidentally bumped into Grand Preceptor Meng,

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.039
nearly ruining a portrait bestowed upon him by His Majesty.

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.519
The Grand Preceptor not only didn't punish me,

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.280
but upon learning my foster mother was ill,

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.920
he even rewarded me with a large sum of silver.

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:25.599
You remember that quite clearly.

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.159
Of course.

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:29.800
I also remember the Grand Preceptor treasured that painting.

00:35:30.159 --> 00:35:31.360
I stole a couple of glances at the time

00:35:31.679 --> 00:35:32.679
and saw the characters for "tian xia" (the world).

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.039
Seeing my curiosity, the Grand Preceptor

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:36.320
said it was inscribed by His Majesty:

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.159
"The fate of the nation is every citizen's responsibility."

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.800
Grand Preceptor Meng is quite kind-hearted,

00:35:41.079 --> 00:35:42.239
explaining so much to you.

00:35:42.639 --> 00:35:44.639
But, speaking of which, it's strange.

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.239
I unintentionally saw the seal on it.

00:35:47.599 --> 00:35:49.039
It didn't seem to be His Majesty's.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.840
You must have seen wrong.

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:52.440
Why would Grand Preceptor Meng lie to you?

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:55.000
You're right.

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:57.440
But the Grand Preceptor was indeed odd that day.

00:35:59.639 --> 00:36:02.199
He seemed very afraid someone else would see the painting.

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.079
Could Father have entrusted the Map of the Nine Provinces

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.119
to Grand Preceptor Meng?

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:10.559
Mr. Coffin!

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:11.840
Fifth Princess.

00:36:13.039 --> 00:36:13.840
It's Grand Tutor Guan.

00:36:14.159 --> 00:36:15.239
Mr. Coffin!

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.719
Come play chess with me!

00:36:20.239 --> 00:36:21.079
This old man has matters to attend to.

00:36:28.639 --> 00:36:29.079
I must take my leave.

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.320
Fifth Princess,

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.320
the number of patrolling guards in the palace

00:36:37.559 --> 00:36:38.800
seems to have increased lately.

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:40.519
I heard that a few days ago,

00:36:41.079 --> 00:36:42.079
an assassin broke into the Benevolent Heart Hall.

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.599
His Majesty also ordered Commander He

00:36:47.519 --> 00:36:48.679
to find the assassin within ten days.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.280
Do you know where the map is hidden?

00:36:51.559 --> 00:36:52.440
Not yet.

00:36:53.039 --> 00:36:55.239
We can't just keep waiting.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:05.519
I'll send someone to investigate the Benevolent Heart Hall.

00:37:13.719 --> 00:37:14.519
Fifth Princess,

00:37:14.719 --> 00:37:16.079
everything in here

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.519
was made by your own hands, Princess.

00:37:21.599 --> 00:37:22.880
The Princess spent a lot of time on these.

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.679
What are you two whispering about?

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:26.920
The palace gates are locked at You hour.

00:37:27.159 --> 00:37:28.960
Don't worry.

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:32.000
We'll return the Fifth Princess before You hour.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.519
Inside the Princess's bundle,

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:35.679
spare clothes are carefully prepared.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:38.719
You understand.

00:38:15.599 --> 00:38:16.360
Remember. Hurry up and go.

00:38:16.639 --> 00:38:17.320
Eldest Cousin!

00:38:34.679 --> 00:38:35.639
Are we there yet?

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:00.320
I'll take you on horseback.

00:39:00.639 --> 00:39:03.559
Mr. Coffin says

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:10.440
men and women must keep their distance.

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:13.480
Princess?

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:14.880
Princess?

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:33.519
Princess?

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:34.440
Where is she?

00:39:47.639 --> 00:39:48.199
Ru Feng!

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:56.599
Fifth Princess!
Don't move.
