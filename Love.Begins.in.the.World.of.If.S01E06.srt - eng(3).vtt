"Love Begins in the World of If"
(Episode 6)

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.400
(One year ago)

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.800
About him...

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.520
To be honest, I didn't know him that well.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:53.690
Kano.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.280
You look worried.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.040
Huh?

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:08.770
Oh... thanks.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:11.950
Okami?

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.360
Wrong.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:15.950
It's pronounced Ogami.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.890
You don't even know
your own colleague's name.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.740
Guess you really aren't
interested in other people.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.990
I know this is sudden,
and you might not be happy about it,

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.090
but starting today, you're in sales.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.300
Let's work well together.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.290
I wanted to help him.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.100
That's what I thought at the time.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:40.710
Kano.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.450
About that project we had
a meeting for yesterday,

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.690
want to work on the materials together?

00:01:44.691 --> 00:01:47.340
Oh, I'm already working
on them. Almost done.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.280
Huh?

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.740
I can go to the next meeting by myself.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.750
Are you sure you'll be okay on your own?

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.560
I'll be fine.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.340
All right.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.850
He just kept handling
everything on his own, quietly.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.010
He worked himself to the bone.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.330
And because of that...

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.170
I didn't realize he'd already
reached his breaking point.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.279
You can't just delay
the deadline like this.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.840
It's causing a lot of trouble for us.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.480
I'm very sorry.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.900
Why is Ogami apologizing?

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.380
It's my fault...

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.130
Kano, so completely cornered...

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.620
It was the first time I'd
ever seen him like that.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.500
As his colleague, I
had to look out for him.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.800
No.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.660
It's my fault. I left the work to you.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.350
I'll go with you to apologize.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.500
His hand... it was ice-cold.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.920
I never asked you to do that.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.540
How could I let you go?

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.480
I hurt Kano's pride.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.990
So, from then on,

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.380
I decided to just watch
over him from a distance.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.180
That's what I decided.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.960
And Kano-san doesn't seem
to have any sales targets.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.600
That sales tech position...

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.820
seems pretty easy.

00:03:21.373 --> 00:03:23.233
What are you talking about?

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.210
Huh?

00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:27.520
You think he has it easy?

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.489
He was transferred on short notice,

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.890
but he handles all his work
by himself and does a great job.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.260
He works much harder than you think.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.600
I'm sorry.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.560
But...

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.960
the number of people who
understand that about him...

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.770
is far too small.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.900
I heard there was some
trouble with Ibushi-san.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.090
It's my responsibility.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.000
It has nothing to do with you, Ogami.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.520
He was so down, which is rare for him...

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.420
Even if it was just for comfort...

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.540
I just wanted to help him relax a little.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
(You'll be fine.)

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.660
Didn't you go straight home?

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:37.830
I could ask you the same thing.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.770
What are you still doing here so late?

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.330
Did you change Tomioka's
materials without telling him again?

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.280
You're shouldering someone
else's burden all by yourself again.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.390
Stop trying to carry
everything on your own.

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.110
You're going to burn
yourself out at this rate.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.620
If you say you don't need it,

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.640
I'll just eat it myself.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:16.960
This is for you.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:20.590
It's chocolate.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:23.830
Chocolate...

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:25.970
You like it, right?

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.790
You have a ton of it at your desk.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:40.690
Well, I'm heading out.

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:42.710
You should head home soon, too.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.530
Even if it was just a little,

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.340
I hoped that stubbornness
of his would change.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.210
That's what I was hoping for.

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.070
Who was it...

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.970
who changed him?

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.556
Was it the advice from that
overprotective sales rep?

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:05.980
Maybe I have that person to thank.

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:15.200
Excuse me.

00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:16.921
Are there any changes that need to be made?

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:18.810
- Let me see.
- Okay.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.250
The person I truly love is...

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.280
this Ogami.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.510
I've realized it now,

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:30.500
but what am I supposed to do?

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.260
Thank you.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.420
What's wrong?

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.640
No, it's nothing.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.070
I see.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.850
There's no way I could confess to him.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.740
Besides...

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.940
there's no way Ogami
would be interested in me.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.020
Good work.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.470
You too.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:12.760
Oh, Kano-san.

00:07:12.761 --> 00:07:13.860
Did you hear?

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:15.320
Hear what?

00:07:15.452 --> 00:07:17.221
Starting in April, besides you, Kano-san,

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.010
they're adding more
sales tech staff.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.660
Huh? Seriously?

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.420
Yeah, the department head said so.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.950
Apparently, Ogami-san pushed for it.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.609
He said that having only you, Kano-san,
handle sales tech

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.000
was too much of a burden.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.080
And that they should transfer
more people to the department.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:37.990
I can't believe Ogami
would do something like that.

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:40.820
Is this what they call camaraderie?

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.960
No, that's not it.

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:44.350
Right.

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:46.250
I should do something to thank him.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:49.630
Here are your items.

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:54.030
This is the first time I've
ever stood in a line like this.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.290
Since he knows about a place like this,

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.230
maybe this Ogami...

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.810
has a sweet tooth, too?

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:06.600
If he's just like the other Ogami...

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.020
I want to be with you forever.

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.020
I guess this means I'm pursuing you.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.380
No way.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:18.099
Okay, Irisawa-san will be in
charge of the product explanation,

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.380
and Nagata-san, you'll manage
the schedule. Is that okay?

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:21.780
- No problem.
- Got it.

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.580
Then let's proceed with this plan.

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:25.659
All right, I'll be counting
on you all tomorrow.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:26.940
- Right.
- Good work.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.360
Good work today.

00:08:28.686 --> 00:08:29.986
Oh, right.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:31.480
I just got some dorayaki.

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:34.030
These are from that super
delicious place in Asakusa.

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:36.460
Wow, Mitsuno-san, you
really know your stuff.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.040
I'll have to look it up.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.750
Huh? But Ogami-san doesn't
really eat sweets, does he?

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.590
He doesn't. These are a gift for a client.

00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:46.690
Let's go to a cake shop next week.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:48.310
I'm craving some Christmas cake.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.100
Sounds good.

00:08:49.101 --> 00:08:52.126
I'll just enjoy watching you eat with
that happy look on your face, Mitsuno-san.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:53.349
You're making me blush.

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:54.559
Well then, I'll be sure to eat a lot!

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.680
Wait, then I should be
the one treating, right?

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.240
Kano.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.800
Oh, good.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:15.180
You're still here.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.380
Yeah, just...

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:18.690
some personal business.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:20.180
I see.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:23.540
Are you free this weekend?

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.040
Why?

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.360
A lot has happened
with the Ibushi-san case,

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.660
so the two of us should have a debriefing.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.540
A debriefing...

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.210
Don't look so scared.

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:38.760
It is the end of the year, after all.

00:09:38.761 --> 00:09:40.481
Let's go out for a nice meal, the two of us.

00:09:41.902 --> 00:09:43.272
I'm craving some Christmas cake.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:44.300
Sounds good.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.540
I'll just enjoy watching you eat with
that happy look on your face, Mitsuno-san.

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:51.060
Don't waste your time on someone like me.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.770
You should just focus on things
that make you happy, Ogami.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:57.890
What's that supposed to mean?

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.640
So cold.

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:48.700
I...

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:52.550
I really am in love with him.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.810
If it were the other Ogami,

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.560
things wouldn't have turned out this way.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:27.640
Huh?

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:33.570
Kano.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:37.730
Ogami?

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.000
Why are you...

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:45.210
I should be asking you that.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.300
We were having drinks,
and you just disappeared.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.980
So I came looking for you.

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:52.520
Having drinks...

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.040
You're...

00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:59.090
the other Ogami?

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:07.020
Don't make me worry like that.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:12.800
It's okay.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:15.430
I'm here for you.

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.200
It's fine. You've got this.

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:47.720
I'm so sorry.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.690
Thank you, Ogami.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.260
But...

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:57.260
the person you love isn't me.

00:12:58.950 --> 00:12:59.950
Huh...?

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.730
And the person I love is...

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.860
I'm such an idiot.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.260
This was my last chance...

00:13:32.656 --> 00:13:33.640
Kano.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:39.440
Ogami?

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:41.340
Huh?

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:42.500
You're the Ogami from here?

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:46.030
You're so cold.

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:51.820
Are you crying?

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.450
No.

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:58.630
Hey, wait.

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:00.410
What are you doing here?

00:14:01.773 --> 00:14:04.023
You seemed off, so I followed you.

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:06.860
And then...

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.410
I heard you talking to some guy.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.320
Were you two fighting?

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:15.030
No.

00:14:15.266 --> 00:14:16.366
It wasn't like that.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:17.660
It's just...

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:20.740
Who made you cry?

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:22.290
Is it someone I know?

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:31.740
Don't tell me...

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:35.490
It was that overprotective
sales rep, wasn't it?

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.180
Um, well...

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.520
I guess you could say that...?

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.970
Forget about a guy like that.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:07.680
You might feel grateful to him.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.360
But compared to someone
who makes you cry...

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.720
I can cherish you so much more.

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:19.210
Can't I...

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.850
take his place?

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.960
W-Wait a minute.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.790
Are you... really the
Ogami from this world?

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.540
What do you mean, "from this world"?

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:45.820
Oh, no...

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:48.370
I meant...

00:15:48.395 --> 00:15:50.395
I thought you and
Mitsuno-san were hitting it off.

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:53.700
If that's the case, then this is...

00:15:54.933 --> 00:15:55.933
Mitsuno-san?

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.520
Yeah.

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:03.580
I just asked her for a big favor at work.

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:06.510
So I offered to treat her
to a meal to thank her.

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:10.210
Oh, I see...

00:16:10.417 --> 00:16:13.000
So if there's nothing going on between me and
Mitsuno-san... does that mean you'll accept me?

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:14.820
Huh?

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:19.220
It's not a matter of
accepting you or not...

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:21.510
It's just... why so suddenly?

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:35.670
I've always been worried about you.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.476
Always shouldering everything by yourself,

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:41.980
always pushing yourself to the limit.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.740
But I knew how hard you were trying.

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:50.346
So I figured if you insisted
on doing things that way,

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:52.570
I would just quietly watch
over you from the sidelines.

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:57.140
But then you suddenly changed,
like you were a different person.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:01.100
You used to be so stubborn,

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:04.250
but you became so much more flexible.

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:06.400
I was genuinely happy for you.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:12.880
But...

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:18.260
I didn't want the person who
changed you... to be someone else.

00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:24.010
I don't even understand
these feelings myself.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.280
That's why...

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:34.510
I think I must have
fallen in love with you.

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:46.440
All this time,

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.200
I've wanted you to acknowledge me.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:55.560
I worked so hard because
I wanted to be your equal.

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:10.310
It's because when it comes to you, Ogami,

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:12.070
I'm in love.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:16.950
The one I love...

00:18:19.126 --> 00:18:20.606
is the you who's standing right here.

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.710
Are you sure you want to choose me?

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:07.870
You're the only one I want.

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:13.010
More than that overprotective guy?

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:16.280
Well...

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:21.530
he might have been a little too doting.

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:27.560
You don't like being doted on?

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:33.780
That's not it... if it's you, Ogami,

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:36.580
I might be interested.

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:37.610
But...

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:41.550
Okay.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:44.320
Okay?

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:50.620
W-Wait...

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:52.140
Hm?

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:53.580
Why all of a sudden...?

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.240
Why?

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.320
Didn't you say you
wanted me to dote on you?

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:02.590
Your hands are cold.

00:20:03.883 --> 00:20:05.083
Are you nervous?

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.250
Of course I am.

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:11.110
Should I stop?

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.500
I'm nervous,

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:17.890
but if it's with you, it's okay.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.270
W-Wait, I'm not ready for this...

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:41.110
I can't wait any longer.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.860
Wait... no... not there...

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:53.800
You're so cute when you keep saying no.

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:56.170
I could just eat you up.

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:02.510
Ogami.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:05.800
Hm?

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.970
You really are a big, bad wolf.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.690
I'll take that as a compliment.

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:33.110
As you wish. I'll dote on you all you want.

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:57.630
Thank you, Ogami.

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.760
Thank you for always watching over me.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.340
But from now on, you
have to tell me everything.

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.790
The good things,

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:14.700
and the things that make you anxious.

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:17.449
Anything and everything about you...

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:18.740
I want to know it all.

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:22.190
Okay.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:27.880
And...

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:30.280
thanks for this, too.

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:33.100
But I thought you didn't like sweets.

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.020
I don't.

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:36.790
But...

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:56.830
it's delicious when I eat it like this.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.720
You're not cold anymore.

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:27.370
"Reflects your ideal self"?

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:29.239
It doesn't just reflect you.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.980
It can take you to another world.

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:33.000
Another world?

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:37.270
Yeah. An ideal world
where your ideal self exists.

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:40.250
What's that supposed to mean?
