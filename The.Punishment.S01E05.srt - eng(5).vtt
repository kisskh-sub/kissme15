Alright.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.960
Let's serve two plates for now
—let's eat, Mai.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.390

[Hanzhou City; 2002]

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:15.800
You go ahead.
There's still one more plate here.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.960
Come to the table; everyone's hungry.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.290
Xiaoyue, come to the table. Stop reading.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.400
Senior Feng,

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.120
in Xu Li's teacher's statement, it says

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.550
Xu Li was picked up by a relative

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.000
after getting drunk.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.350
Who exactly is that person?

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.440
Who knows?

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.070
Xu Li herself blacked out.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.040
Right now, whatever her teacher says goes.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.230
But judging by her teacher's attitude,

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.500
she's probably lying.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.920
She's definitely lying.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.520
Xiaoyue, time to eat.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.280
Got it.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.880
How can you tell?

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:50.560
How can I tell?

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.650
It's simple.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.350
A university teacher

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.320
taking students to a competition should,

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.280
by all accounts,

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.790
protect her students,

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:58.280
right?

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.280
Xu Li got drunk and lost consciousness,

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.150
then was picked up
by a so-called "relative"

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.950
without the teacher
even verifying his identity.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.560
Isn't that suspicious?

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.590
Also,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.400
during the questioning,

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.039
I felt she was really nervous.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.480
When we showed her

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.150
the suspect sketch
based on Xu Li's description,

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.080
she immediately

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.760
said she didn't recognize it—

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.870
almost like she was avoiding something.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.000
Isn't that strange?

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.900
So the teacher is in cahoots.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.680
Whether she's involved or not,

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.560
at the very least, a normal person

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.620
looking at a sketch

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.200
would at least examine it

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.150
carefully

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.710
and try to recall—

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.120
but she's different.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.680
The moment she saw it, she immediately
said it wasn't him.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.509
There's definitely something wrong here.

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:41.710
If she's in on it,

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:42.590
we need to keep a close eye on her.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.350
This kind of thing
probably isn't her first time.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.680
What if she's being coerced?

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.050
Then whoever's behind her

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.210
must be quite capable.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.039
So,

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.950
we need to have a good talk with her,

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.130
including those students.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.680
The most crucial thing now

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.920
is to find the person in that sketch.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.430
No matter what kind of troublemaker
is behind her,

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.560
we'll take him down.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.020
You've still got
that youthful drive, Boss.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.730
We'll handle it—

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.270
everything that needs doing will get done.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.150
But first, you've got to eat your fill
at this hot pot meal

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.680
before you can do it, right?

This is Boss Mai—

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.310
the one I mentioned to you before.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.260
I brought him along today
to play a couple of rounds.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:16.480
Search him.

all our station officers are in position.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.760
Every exit from the mountain
has been blocked.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.360
Copy that.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.600

I'll still crush you.

Still no sign of those two?

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.720
They probably know you're watching them,

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.480
so they're too scared to show up.

Don't lock me up.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:00.750

Lock him up?

What is it? Tell me.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.280
My luck's been terrible tonight.
I haven't won a single hand.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.040
How about

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:39.870
lending me a bit more

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.570
so I can turn things around?

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:42.720
Brother,

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:45.360
you've borrowed a lot tonight already.

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:47.300
How will you pay it back?

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.520
I'll pay with my life if I have to.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.890
Isn't this how you run a gambling den?

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.120
You took my money

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.240
but won't let me try to win it back?

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.360
Of course you can.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.830

I have no money, just my life.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:09.390

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:16.530
show me what it's like.

Or do you think we

Do you have something?

If it weren't for this video,

I wouldn't be alive today.

I was planning to give it
to Captain Hu before.

But then he...

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.490
He was fine and then he just...

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.290
What's in the video?

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:21.410
I have a condition.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.270
Go ahead.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.640
I want

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:32.830
the leaders
of the Public Security Bureau present

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:34.430
before I hand over the video.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.400
You want the leaders
of the Municipal Bureau present?

by that?

our rank isn't high enough,

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:50.520
or are you worried
we won't handle it properly?

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.210

was it just a chance encounter,

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:13.350
or were they having a meal together?

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.960
I need to know.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.690

I knew where he usually parked his car.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.070

But then...

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:51.480
Then I ended up

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:53.640

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:15.000
Later, I tried some noise reduction

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.330
on my computer,

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:18.710

called Captain Hu.

He said the police tech could handle it.

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.900
Director Ye's arrangements.

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:25.210
I think the urgent priority now

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:27.370
is to find a breakthrough

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.270
from the suspects we've arrested.

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:31.680
Let's not jump to conclusions
about whether the video exists,

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.200
but if we do find it,

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:36.170
it would corroborate
Wang Ming's statement.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.100
Captain Zhong,

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:38.790
what's your opinion?

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:42.160
I also think

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:44.510
it's more important
to interrogate those suspects first.

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:45.350
Also,

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:46.680
we should have someone re-interview

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:48.000
the victim.

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.290
There might be other clues we can uncover.

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:55.200
Interrogate them as soon as possible.

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:55.920
Yes.

00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:58.650
Director Ye.

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:01.900
Have a seat.

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:14.670
Do you have something to say?

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:17.450
Director Ye,

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:19.590
Wang Ming's place

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:22.470
originally had surveillance cameras.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.400
But someone

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:25.510
cut off the power in advance.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.200
And whoever went there

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.790
went straight for
where he hid the memory card.

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:30.920
What does this mean?

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:33.050
Isn't this clearly a leak?

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.980
We have a problem inside our department.

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:38.720
I think it's time to tell you now.

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:43.350
Here.

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.750
Mentor,

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:56.510
I'm sorry.

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:01.440
I've made up my mind.

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:05.170
I can only use this clumsy method.

00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:08.520
I believe after you hear me out,

00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:13.210
you'll understand why I did this,

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:14.510
right?

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.000
Ma Jin and Luo Bo

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:21.120
have committed so many crimes.

00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:25.780
I've been investigating them
for a long time.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.760
I've tried many approaches.

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:30.650
But every lead I follow ends up nowhere.

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:32.280
Ends up nowhere.

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.880
Now even my informant has disappeared.

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:39.260
Because Ma Jin has
many powerful people behind him.

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:43.200
The entire network of connections

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.500
in Hanzhou

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:48.260
is like a web,

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.730
and right now I'm trapped in it.

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:54.680
I can't break free

00:33:58.180 --> 00:33:59.380
or make any progress.

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:03.370
They're targeting me now,

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:06.710
threatening me,

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.520
harassing my family,

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:13.280
smearing my reputation,

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.620
and now they've suspended me.

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:24.909
They just don't want me investigating.

00:34:25.489 --> 00:34:27.750
Ma Jin has people inside the department.

00:34:29.219 --> 00:34:30.710
I know that once I'm gone,

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:34.940
these cases will sink to the bottom,

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:39.170
never to be looked into again.

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:43.400
I don't have Senior Hongchao's
relentless drive

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:47.110
or Senior Feng's cleverness.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.659
But I remember what you taught us:

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.540
when ordinary people have troubles,

00:34:56.889 --> 00:34:59.150
they can only rely on us police officers.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.000
If we don't help them,

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:03.700
no one will.

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.720
There are so many victims

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:12.750
who shouldn't be forgotten.

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.190
Since they want me on my knees,

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:20.890
I'll make a big scene instead.

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.440
I'll use my life

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.480
to tear open a gap

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:35.440
and light a fire.

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:38.620
The evidence against Jinding Group

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:43.160
will be sent to you along with this video.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.200
Please tell Senior Hongchao

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:49.630
and Senior Feng that I'm sorry.

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.080
I had to do this.

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:00.330
I had to do this.

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:07.890
I leave my parents in their care.

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:22.630
After Xiaoyue's incident,

00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:24.990
I received the digital camera he sent me.

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:27.110
The reason I didn't tell you

00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:29.440
was because the case wasn't resolved yet.

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:31.630
Also, like you,

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:35.150
I needed time to process this.

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:37.830
Who exactly wanted to

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:42.030
transfer Xiaoyue away back then?

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.330
The city bureau.

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:45.680
An anonymous report

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.190
accused

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:49.230
Hu Xiaoyue of taking bribes.

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:55.840
He didn't tell you

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:57.200
probably because

00:36:58.630 --> 00:36:59.710
he didn't want

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:01.000
to drag you into it.

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:04.880
Qin Feng,

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:07.890
you need to keep playing your part.

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:13.130
Understood.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.230
Should we inform

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:19.400
Lao Mai about Xiaoyue's situation?

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.030
Tell him.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.750
He deserves an answer.

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:31.460
[Inquiry Room 3]

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:35.030
That won't help.

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.920
He's a hard nut.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.880
He only admitted
to violent debt collection

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.480
and denied everything else.

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.920
What about the police uniform issue?

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.190
He claimed Xiaoyue gave it to him,

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:46.110
just won't admit Luo Bo's

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:47.190
involvement.

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:50.620
As it stands, our evidence
is indeed lacking.

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:51.400
Crazy,

Luo Bo go for now.

00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:59.810
Please answer the question I just asked.

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:03.630
Officer, I can see you're
truly dedicated to your job.

How much do you make in a month?

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:07.880

Fix your attitude.

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.000
You're so diligent.

You're much better than
those useless people working for me.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.280
Listen, Officer,

I'll pay you triple your salary.

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:21.920
Let me tell you,

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:24.120
the benefits are much better than here.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:27.230
Captain Qin,

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:29.230
are you trying to poach my staff?

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:30.490
You've got some nerve.

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.900
I just appreciate talent.

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:34.690
This guy is really dedicated.

Well,

Scar has confessed everything.

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:40.360
He's the one who kidnapped them.

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:42.090
He collected all the money too.

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:43.830
You had nothing to do with it.

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:46.280
Thank you, Captain Qin,
for seeing things clearly.

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:47.420
We made a mistake.

00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:48.810
We misunderstood you.

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:51.360
But your little friend

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:52.590
probably won't be

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:54.000

Take good care of his family.

00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:59.310
Captain Qin, he's not my friend.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.510
He's just a regular employee
at our company.

00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:02.460
But don't worry.

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:04.670
I'll definitely take care of his family.

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:06.870
I'm actually curious about something.

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:09.440
Someone as capable as Scar

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:11.530
is still working for you.

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:14.170
You must have some powerful connections.

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:15.920
It's not about connections.

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:18.440
It's just that our company's benefits

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:20.160

Captain Qin,

00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:25.360

alright?

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:34.000
I'd be afraid to take the job.

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:36.710
Nothing at all.

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:38.200
I'm just here

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.590
to thank you.

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:42.920
As far as I recall, you and I

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.360
don't have any business dealings.

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.840
What are you thanking me for?

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:50.070
If you were in business like me,
I'd be out of a job.

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:52.200
I'd have gone back to farming long ago.

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:54.880
Both of our time is valuable.

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:56.150
Let's get to the point.

00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:58.050
Well,

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:00.670
there's this group of criminals

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:02.280
who've been using the Jinding Group's name

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:03.760
to swindle people

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.190
and you've caught them.

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:06.310
That's great.

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:10.330
I came to thank you in person.

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:13.030
Well,

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:15.480
I'm not familiar with the details.

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:18.080
Police catching criminals

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:19.190
is just part of the job.

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:20.670
That's our job.

00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:23.090
No need to thank me.

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:26.360
I have other matters to attend to.

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:27.090
Director Ye.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:28.440
I...

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:29.590
There's one more thing I'd like to say.

00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:30.230
It's...

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:32.120
Mr. Ma, is there something else?

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:34.710
I just wanted to mention—among that group,

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:36.110
there really are a few

00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:38.170
who used to work at our Jinding Group,

00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:39.190
but

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:40.590
they were fired long ago.

00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:44.960
You should have said so earlier.

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.360
Why beat around the bush?

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:49.000
So you want me to make an exception.

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:49.960
No, no, no.

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:52.020
I just came to make my position clear.

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:53.710
Because these people are despicable.

00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:55.510
They must be severely punished.

00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:58.240
Give them the harshest sentence possible.

00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:00.280
You want me to hand down harsh sentences.

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:00.840
Yes.

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:04.150
Is the Public Security Bureau

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:07.330
a tool for you and the Jinding Group
to settle scores?

00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:10.670
How they are sentenced

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:11.840
is up to the court.

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.400
It's not something you and I
can decide with a few words.

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:15.840
Your thinking is flawed.

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:17.490
Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Ma?

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:19.550
Yes, I think it's simple.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.480
Excuse me.

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:23.410
Among these people,

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:25.400
there's someone named Luo Bo.

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:27.060
He's your relative, isn't he?

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:30.280
He's just a younger relative.

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:31.480
I was wondering

00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:34.110
why you'd try to guide me
on how to handle this.

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:37.590
By reason or by sentiment,
that shouldn't be the case.

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:38.770
Maybe

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:40.630
you've got too much sway.

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:43.030
With so many connections
within the system,

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:44.760
you've probably grown used to it.

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:46.220
Actually, let me tell you,

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.000
within the system,

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:50.880
you and I have known
each other the longest—

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:52.400
we could be considered friends.

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:54.630
With others, it's just
a nod of acquaintance.

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:56.860
That's why I dare to

00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:58.630
ask for favors sometimes.

00:42:58.630 --> 00:43:01.030
Luo Bo is cleared.
He can be released today.

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:03.440
However, Mr. Ma,

00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:06.440
we could possibly become anything,

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:08.380
except friends.

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:10.710
Why?

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.060
Because I'm not brave enough.

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:17.590
Being friends with you requires courage.

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:22.210
I'm leaving.

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.200
You're not brave enough?

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:31.760
If only you were really not brave.
