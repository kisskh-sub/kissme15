00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.680
A Lan

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:59.760
Princess, you're awake.

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:10.240
Fourth Sister.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.719
Was the person rescued?

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.919
Don't worry.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.120
They're fine.

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:17.080
I never expected

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:20.240
that you'd care for him so much now.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.439
Fourth Princess.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.360
The imperial physician says the princess is out of danger.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.479
You haven't rested all night.

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:30.560
Please return to the palace first.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.599
I will take care of things here.

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:34.000
Fourth Sister.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.240
A Lan is fine.

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.319
You should go back first.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.240
If anything happens to A Lan,

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.719
you must report to me promptly.

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:45.719
Then rest well.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.879
Don't do anything foolish again.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.120
The person was really rescued.

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.960
Is everything alright?

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:00.199
Rest assured.

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.919
He's perfectly fine.

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:03.159
The Fourth Princess is right.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.719
Princess, you must never do anything foolish again.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.960
Even if you like Lord Yuwen so much,

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:10.840
you can't disregard your own life.

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:11.680
Yes.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.199
I've heard all about it.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.000
The princess, worried about Lord Yuwen,

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:18.680
jumped into the water without hesitation.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.639
It's spread throughout the entire palace.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.159
His Majesty is both worried and angry.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.280
I must also advise you.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.520
Leaving aside whether Lord Yuwen needed your rescue,

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:29.280
even if he did,

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.039
you must act within your capabilities.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.800
Stop.

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:34.439
I'm asking about Commander He.

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:37.400
Princess, don't use Commander He as a shield.

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.120
It's perfectly normal to like Lord Yuwen.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.120
Don't be embarrassed.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.199
Your train of thought is hard to follow.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.919
How is He Lianchen?

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.439
The miracle doctor who treated you before

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.680
is still staying at the Yuwen Mansion.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.159
Lord He was taken to the Yuwen Mansion last night.

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.879
He still hasn't woken up.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:00.439
Xixi.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.560
Help me get ready.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.120
I'm going to the Yuwen Mansion.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.520
To see Lord Yuwen?

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.719
Alright.

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:08.639
This servant will also help.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.639
He would kindly save me?

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.800
He must have ulterior motives.

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:43.519
Princess.

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:45.120
He... greets the princess.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.920
Where's Eldest Cousin?

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.000
His Lordship is in his room.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.600
Princess.

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:04.360
Careful.

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:34.839
Seen enough?

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.879
Eldest Cousin.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.680
Are you and Commander He both alright?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.439
Get out.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.079
It's good that Eldest Cousin is fine.

00:05:51.079 --> 00:05:53.160
Father asks if Commander He is dead.

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:55.160
He's not dead. Now get out.

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:12.319
Princess.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.399
Where is Lord Yuwen?

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.519
I already said Lord Yuwen is fine.

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:23.560
Why must the princess rush here

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.720
the moment she wakes up?

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:27.720
Coming is one thing,

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:31.319
but bringing so many miracle medicines too?

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:34.560
The princess is truly thoughtful.

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:43.399
Judging by last night's events,

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:45.759
Yuwen Rui and the assassin who infiltrated Benevolent Heart Hall

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:46.519
are not working together.

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:49.560
Therefore, on the night of the birthday banquet,

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:52.279
the one plotting to steal the map wasn't Yuwen Rui.

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:54.480
And the one who poisoned me wasn't him either.

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:56.839
This is a huge misunderstanding.

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:00.199
Since it wasn't Yuwen Rui who poisoned me,

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:02.079
then the jade pendant...

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:07.160
Fifth Princess.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.560
Your jade pendant.

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:27.959
Why does this handwriting look so familiar?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.519
Xixi.

00:07:30.839 --> 00:07:31.519
What about that note?

00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:35.920
The one Commander He dropped by the dry well.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.720
This note was written by Yuwen Rui to He Lianchen.

00:07:55.399 --> 00:07:57.199
But later, their positions differed

00:07:57.439 --> 00:07:58.279
and their political views clashed.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.920
Gradually, they became like strangers.

00:08:05.319 --> 00:08:06.680
Darn it, this cannon fodder constitution.

00:08:07.439 --> 00:08:08.480
Have I stumbled upon

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.519
some unsavory secret again?

00:08:23.279 --> 00:08:24.240
I shall take my leave now.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:38.879
What's in your hand?

00:09:10.279 --> 00:09:11.000
Eldest Cousin.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.559
Eldest Cousin, I...

00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:39.960
My lord.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.159
Commander He has woken up.

00:09:58.799 --> 00:09:59.480
Fifth Princess.

00:09:59.679 --> 00:10:00.440
Chief Grand Secretary.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.879
Fortunately, he was rescued ashore in time.

00:10:03.399 --> 00:10:05.200
Thus, Lord He was spared from death.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.919
The opponent coated the hidden weapon with poison.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.960
This commoner has already helped Lord He detoxify.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.840
He is now out of danger.

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:14.799
Then this commoner will take his leave

00:10:15.039 --> 00:10:16.600
to prescribe a remedy for Lord He.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.480
I heard the Fifth Princess

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.080
entered the water out of concern for the Chief Grand Secretary

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.159
but accidentally saved my life.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.480
Regardless,

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.919
the Fifth Princess's life-saving grace

00:10:44.919 --> 00:10:46.000
is etched in my heart.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.480
If you have something to say, speak.

00:10:56.559 --> 00:10:57.360
Eldest Cousin.

00:10:57.799 --> 00:10:59.159
A Lan will step out first.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:10:59.840
Fifth Princess.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.000
You already know so much.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.720
Won't you hear the secret to the end?

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.879
Prince Ning sent people to infiltrate the palace

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.919
to steal the Map of the Nine Provinces.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.679
The map the assassin held last night

00:11:19.159 --> 00:11:20.320
was a map of the Meng Mansion.

00:11:21.039 --> 00:11:22.039
Could it be because

00:11:22.799 --> 00:11:25.480
the whereabouts of the Map of the Nine Provinces are related to the Meng Mansion?

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.159
Prince Ning...

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.840
Last night, you entered the water to save me.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.240
Could it be noticed by others

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.039
that I am actually working for you?

00:11:46.559 --> 00:11:47.120
It's fine.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.279
I've already had Rufeng spread the word

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.480
that I entered the water only to catch the assassin,

00:11:51.919 --> 00:11:52.600
not to save you.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.480
I'm just cannon fodder.

00:11:59.879 --> 00:12:01.279
I don't want to know anything.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.320
Eldest Cousin.

00:12:04.679 --> 00:12:06.080
A Lan wishes to return to the palace.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.120
Fifth Princess.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.159
Talk with me.

00:12:16.159 --> 00:12:17.360
The Fifth Princess is quite the actress.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.480
Why pretend to be dumb?

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.519
After I was poisoned that day,

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.200
I didn't remember many things.

00:12:39.679 --> 00:12:40.600
I only vaguely remembered

00:12:40.759 --> 00:12:42.399
someone trying to steal something from Benevolent Heart Hall.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.600
The poisoner definitely wanted to silence me.

00:12:46.159 --> 00:12:47.639
So I started pretending to be stupid.

00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:49.919
I didn't see clearly who it was.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.000
But Commander He said

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.120
the assassin who broke into Benevolent Heart Hall was Prince Ning's man.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.440
Then the poisoning

00:12:56.559 --> 00:12:58.120
must be connected to Prince Ning.

00:12:59.399 --> 00:13:00.639
After losing her memory, the Fifth Princess

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.320
has become much smarter.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.879
Compared to Eldest Cousin,

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.200
I'm still far behind.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:08.639
By the way,

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.080
thank you for saving me yesterday.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.159
This jade pendant was left to me by my Imperial Grandmother.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.120
It is priceless.

00:13:18.399 --> 00:13:20.360
I'll give it to you as a thank-you gift.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.120
Fifth Princess, you don't need to thank me.

00:13:24.919 --> 00:13:26.039
I didn't intend to save you.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.279
It's just that

00:13:28.519 --> 00:13:29.960
if the Emperor's favorite Fifth Princess

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.000
were to have an accident,

00:13:31.559 --> 00:13:32.639
I would be held responsible.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.480
Regardless,

00:13:34.639 --> 00:13:35.960
you saved my life after all.

00:13:36.679 --> 00:13:37.919
Besides,

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.320
you helped me pick up this jade pendant last time too.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.799
I didn't find this jade pendant.

00:13:43.559 --> 00:13:44.919
Eunuch Xue found the jade pendant,

00:13:44.919 --> 00:13:46.399
and His Majesty just asked me to pass it to you.

00:13:50.399 --> 00:13:52.480
If you don't want the jade pendant, forget it.

00:13:52.919 --> 00:13:54.440
If you need my help in the future,

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.879
feel free to tell me.

00:13:56.919 --> 00:13:58.000
About the prayer ceremony,

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.600
and your secret with Commander He,

00:13:59.879 --> 00:14:01.399
I absolutely won't tell anyone.

00:14:02.159 --> 00:14:03.519
About me pretending to be dumb,

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.440
I hope you can keep it a secret too.

00:14:10.919 --> 00:14:11.360
By the way,

00:14:12.399 --> 00:14:13.720
the hairpin your mother left you,

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:14.960
I should return it to its owner.

00:14:19.799 --> 00:14:21.720
This hairpin is a fake.

00:14:25.399 --> 00:14:28.039
So you took the real hairpin long ago.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.200
Otherwise? Give it to you?

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.639
I know I did many wrong things before.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.759
But since I lost my memory,

00:14:43.919 --> 00:14:45.240
I've decided to turn over a new leaf.

00:14:46.519 --> 00:14:48.720
For the sake of me saving Commander He,

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.279
as for the past,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.679
can we just write it off?

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:55.759
Fine.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.120
But I have a question to ask.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.320
Did the Fifth Princess really enter the water last night to save me?

00:15:10.039 --> 00:15:11.039
Why save me?

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.120
We have a betrothal, after all.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.600
It was right for me to save you.

00:15:16.039 --> 00:15:16.960
Our betrothal

00:15:17.159 --> 00:15:18.519
was the Empress Dowager's decree before she passed.

00:15:18.759 --> 00:15:20.039
It wasn't by our own choice.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.840
I know you don't want to marry me.

00:15:24.639 --> 00:15:27.279
Anyway, you'll definitely find a way to cancel the betrothal.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.919
Since the Fifth Princess is so clever,

00:15:30.759 --> 00:15:32.559
why not help me think of a way?

00:15:32.759 --> 00:15:33.159
Fine.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.559
Since you put it that way,

00:15:34.759 --> 00:15:36.120
I'll definitely think of a way immediately

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.240
to get Father to cancel our marriage as soon as possible.

00:15:50.159 --> 00:15:52.240
Let's never see each other again.

00:16:09.519 --> 00:16:10.279
Speak if you have something to say.

00:16:11.879 --> 00:16:12.320
My Lord,

00:16:12.759 --> 00:16:14.519
this subordinate feels that the Fifth Princess...

00:16:15.519 --> 00:16:16.919
perhaps she has fallen for you.

00:16:19.679 --> 00:16:20.080
My Lord,

00:16:20.399 --> 00:16:21.600
this subordinate heard last night that

00:16:21.799 --> 00:16:22.639
after you fell into the water,

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.440
the Fifth Princess was worried to death.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.679
She jumped into the water regardless of danger,

00:16:25.679 --> 00:16:26.480
just to save you.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.039
Perhaps she has other motives.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.200
Motives?

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.120
What motives could there be?

00:16:33.679 --> 00:16:36.120
At that time, besides you, only Commander He was underwater.

00:16:36.639 --> 00:16:38.200
She has no connection with Commander He.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.559
There is no reason for her to disregard her own life

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:41.720
for Commander He.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.200
But you are different, My Lord.

00:16:46.799 --> 00:16:48.120
The Fifth Princess saving Commander He

00:16:48.759 --> 00:16:50.440
was at most done in passing.

00:16:52.519 --> 00:16:52.960
My Lord,

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.720
when you asked the Fifth Princess to find a way to cancel the betrothal,

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.559
this subordinate saw she looked very desolate when she left.

00:16:59.919 --> 00:17:00.480
She...

00:17:13.279 --> 00:17:13.799
Father.

00:17:14.559 --> 00:17:16.720
The guards who went to Flying Immortal Pavilion with Commander He said

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.319
Commander He received intelligence

00:17:18.759 --> 00:17:20.000
that the assassin who broke into the palace at night

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:21.839
would appear at Flying Immortal Pavilion last night.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.480
That's why Commander He took men to ambush there,

00:17:24.759 --> 00:17:26.640
leading to the fight with the assassin.

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:31.319
To escape from Commander He and Minister Yuwen,

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.559
the person behind this seems not simple.

00:17:34.039 --> 00:17:35.680
The other party broke into the palace at night

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.559
presumably for the Map of the Nine Provinces.

00:17:43.359 --> 00:17:44.119
About last night's incident,

00:17:44.279 --> 00:17:45.079
do you have any leads?

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.480
The assassin escaped

00:17:46.519 --> 00:17:47.799
and didn't leave any clues.

00:17:50.599 --> 00:17:53.400
You and A Zi go investigate this matter clearly.

00:17:53.559 --> 00:17:55.000
You must ferret out the person behind this.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.240
Your son obeys. Your servant obeys.

00:17:57.799 --> 00:18:00.160
About A Lan falling into the water to save you last night,

00:18:00.359 --> 00:18:01.160
I have heard all about it.

00:18:02.119 --> 00:18:03.799
Since A Lan cares about you so much now,

00:18:04.079 --> 00:18:06.400
go visit her more often when you have time.

00:18:08.119 --> 00:18:08.559
Yes.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.160
Fortunately, you completed the mission safely despite the scare.

00:18:23.599 --> 00:18:25.279
You knew long ago that the person who poisoned me

00:18:25.279 --> 00:18:26.039
wasn't Yuwen Rui.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.400
Yet you didn't say anything to remind me.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.680
Sorry.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.720
Heavenly secrets cannot be revealed.

00:18:34.839 --> 00:18:37.359
I didn't expect Prince Ning to be such a good actor.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.519
The plot is getting more and more complex.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.240
The mission is getting harder and harder.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.960
When can I go home?

00:19:15.119 --> 00:19:15.680
Princess.

00:19:16.519 --> 00:19:18.960
Did Lord Yuwen really ask you to find a way

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:19.960
to cancel the betrothal yourself?

00:19:23.759 --> 00:19:25.400
Lord Yuwen is truly cruel.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.000
The Princess jumped into the water for him,

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.240
risking your very life.

00:19:29.839 --> 00:19:31.640
Yet he actually wants to cancel the betrothal.

00:19:32.519 --> 00:19:33.880
Your servant really misjudged him.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.519
He is simply a heartless

00:19:36.759 --> 00:19:37.759
and ungrateful person.

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:40.000
It has nothing to do with him.

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:44.640
I did all this for myself.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.160
For yourself?

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.119
At a time like this,

00:19:49.119 --> 00:19:50.400
you're still making excuses for him.

00:19:51.519 --> 00:19:52.880
Princess, don't be too sad.

00:19:53.079 --> 00:19:54.519
It is Lord Yuwen's loss.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.240
There are still many young talents in this capital.

00:19:59.319 --> 00:20:00.599
Your servant will definitely keep an eye out for you.

00:20:00.599 --> 00:20:01.720
If... You go do your work first.

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:02.960
I want to be alone for a while.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:13.599
My lord.

00:20:14.519 --> 00:20:15.880
It seems what I said was correct.

00:20:16.599 --> 00:20:18.240
The Fifth Princess truly likes you.

00:20:20.319 --> 00:20:21.160
Who she likes...

00:20:23.319 --> 00:20:24.079
...is none of my concern.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.160
Xi Xi, I only have one card left.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:46.880
Do you want it or not?

00:20:50.319 --> 00:20:53.000
Xi Xi, it seems the Joker is in Xiao Li Zi's hand.

00:20:53.759 --> 00:20:55.119
We're definitely going to lose this round.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:56.400
I'll do it.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.000
This one... anyone want it?

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:04.519
Joker.

00:21:05.599 --> 00:21:06.519
If no one wants it...

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:07.759
I only have one card left.

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:08.720
I... wait!

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:13.920
Four twos!

00:21:14.759 --> 00:21:16.079
And a bomb! We win!

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:18.759
Princess.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.000
I'm the one who loses every time.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:26.640
From now on, I...

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:27.119
Again, again, again!

00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:29.119
...don't want to play Fight the Chancellor with you anymore.

00:21:29.519 --> 00:21:31.160
My forehead is going to get swollen from all the flicks.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.119
Fight the Chancellor?

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.960
You're quite the player, aren't you?

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.920
You two shuffle the cards. I need to go inside for a moment.

00:21:45.759 --> 00:21:46.279
You shuffle.

00:21:46.359 --> 00:21:47.680
All yours, all yours, all yours.

00:21:50.759 --> 00:21:52.519
You've adapted quite quickly.

00:21:53.079 --> 00:21:53.759
Enough chatter.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:54.759
Tell me the mission.

00:22:01.519 --> 00:22:02.359
You've been looking for so long.

00:22:02.759 --> 00:22:03.400
Who needs saving?

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.000
Your mission this time is rather special.

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.240
And also rather... roundabout.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:12.880
Special?

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:14.519
Roundabout?

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.640
You have to save a very special cannon fodder.

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:22.839
What's so special about it?

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.400
It's not human.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:27.759
Is it a god, then?

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.079
It's not a god either.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.079
A demon?

00:22:32.359 --> 00:22:32.759
No.

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.079
Then what is it?

00:22:35.839 --> 00:22:36.799
Actually...

00:22:39.039 --> 00:22:40.440
...it's a pig.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.000
The little black pig from the Meng Mansion.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:42.759
What did you say?

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.359
A pig?

00:22:44.519 --> 00:22:45.680
A little black pig?

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.519
Has a donkey kicked you in the head?

00:22:47.759 --> 00:22:48.680
No personal attacks!

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.000
Personal attack?

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.000
Do you even count as a person?

00:22:52.839 --> 00:22:54.200
Having you save that little black pig...

00:22:54.599 --> 00:22:56.640
...is a decision I made after careful consideration.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:58.920
Don't be ungrateful.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.720
I'm ungrateful?

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.400
Aren't you the one who follows the ironclad rule...

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.240
...that saving one life is better than building a seven-story pagoda?

00:23:06.519 --> 00:23:07.920
Then what do you mean by having me save a pig?

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.160
Is a pig a human?

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.119
If a pig were human, then you'd be the pig.

00:23:12.599 --> 00:23:13.680
You dare call me a pig?

00:23:14.519 --> 00:23:15.680
You'll regret this.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:18.519
By the way...

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:19.680
...where is the little black pig?

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.119
You've already seen it at the Flying Immortal Pavilion.

00:23:22.839 --> 00:23:24.759
As for when it dies...

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.519
...I'll tell you after my anger subsides.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:29.720
Bye-bye.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.519
Explain clearly before you leave!

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:37.880
What kind of Plot Spirit...

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.680
...is this unreliable?

00:23:43.039 --> 00:23:43.519
Your Highness.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:44.599
I've investigated everything clearly.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.680
That little black pig is the beloved pet...

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:47.640
...of the Meng family's young lady, Meng Yinglu.

00:23:47.839 --> 00:23:49.119
She treasures it greatly.

00:23:49.359 --> 00:23:51.079
She won't give it to anyone except the Meng family's young master.

00:23:51.319 --> 00:23:51.880
However...

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:52.839
...if you use your power for personal gain...

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:53.920
...there is still a way...

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.559
...to get your hands on that little black pig.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.119
But come to think of it...

00:24:00.119 --> 00:24:00.559
Your Highness...

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.680
...why are you thinking about the Meng Mansion's little black pig?

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:04.839
Last time I went out of the palace for fun...

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:05.799
...I saw it and thought it was quite cute.

00:24:06.119 --> 00:24:07.319
I wanted to borrow it and raise it for a while.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.839
Can't another pig do?

00:24:10.839 --> 00:24:13.599
Out of three thousand gallons of water, I only want one scoop.

00:24:13.799 --> 00:24:15.319
I only want that little black pig.

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:17.519
I've asked clearly.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.480
Grand Tutor Meng is indeed at the Benevolent Heart Hall right now.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:21.759
Let's go.

00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:27.359
Your Majesty.

00:24:28.039 --> 00:24:30.759
Building the academy is a major undertaking that benefits the state and the people.

00:24:31.279 --> 00:24:34.000
I will certainly not fail Your Majesty's trust in this matter.

00:24:35.279 --> 00:24:37.400
Then I'll trouble you with it, Grand Tutor.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.119
The imperial examinations are approaching.

00:24:39.279 --> 00:24:40.119
At that time, we can...

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:41.160
Fifth Princess!

00:24:41.599 --> 00:24:42.240
Fifth Princess!

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:44.640
His Majesty is currently...

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:45.480
Father!

00:24:45.599 --> 00:24:47.640
A Lan knows how to become smart again!

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.480
The Fifth Princess has now lost all her wits.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.319
Grand Tutor, you must not let this matter leak out.

00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:58.839
Yes.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:06.920
What A Lan means to say is...

00:25:07.079 --> 00:25:08.119
...you dreamed of Consort Chen.

00:25:09.519 --> 00:25:12.240
Imperial Mother said as long as A Lan and that little black pig...

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.319
...stay together every day...

00:25:13.519 --> 00:25:15.839
...I'll become as smart as before.

00:25:16.079 --> 00:25:16.759
Nonsense!

00:25:17.279 --> 00:25:17.920
How could a little black pig...

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.839
Father...

00:25:20.279 --> 00:25:22.720
A Lan wants to become like before.

00:25:28.279 --> 00:25:28.920
Grand Tutor...

00:25:29.079 --> 00:25:30.279
A Lan saw the little black pig...

00:25:30.279 --> 00:25:32.079
...from your household at the Flying Immortal Pavilion.

00:25:32.319 --> 00:25:34.279
It's exactly the same as in A Lan's dream.

00:25:35.359 --> 00:25:36.160
Grand Tutor...

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.559
...can you lend your little black pig to A Lan for a few days?

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:43.960
This...

00:26:20.039 --> 00:26:23.119
Why isn't its fur as black and shiny as before?

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.039
Eat more. Get fatter.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.119
Xi Xi, bring some water.

00:27:01.359 --> 00:27:02.079
Xiao Li Zi.

00:27:03.319 --> 00:27:04.279
Grand Tutor Meng...

00:27:04.799 --> 00:27:06.200
...is trying to fool an idiot, isn't he?

00:27:06.759 --> 00:27:07.559
In my humble opinion...

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.680
...this must be the work of the Meng family's young lady, Meng Yinglu.

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.680
Grand Tutor Meng is upright and incorruptible.

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:13.559
In the imperial court...

00:27:13.759 --> 00:27:15.839
...he's the only one who dares to oppose the Chief Grand Secretary.

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:17.279
Given the Grand Tutor's temperament...

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.240
...he would absolutely never do such a thing.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.440
When will Grand Tutor Meng enter the palace again?

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:23.160
Your Highness.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.920
The Grand Tutor has gone to Tuzhou on His Majesty's orders.

00:27:26.279 --> 00:27:28.200
I'm afraid he won't be back for quite some time.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:35.799
Princess

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.559
Recently, Miss Meng Yinglu of the Meng Mansion

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.440
bought several crates of premium ink.

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:41.079
She also told people in the mansion

00:27:41.079 --> 00:27:42.640
that the Fifth Princess is willful and vicious.

00:27:45.119 --> 00:27:47.599
Young Master Meng Shaojue of the Meng family

00:27:48.319 --> 00:27:50.759
is also a rare, fine young man in this world.

00:27:51.079 --> 00:27:52.839
If he could marry the princess,

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.200
how wonderful that would be.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.559
As the center of the team,

00:28:12.359 --> 00:28:15.400
I feel a bit sad for some reason.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.119
What kind of group is this?

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:23.359
One crazy person,

00:28:24.279 --> 00:28:25.160
one fool,

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.039
one palace maid, one eunuch,

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.759
plus a pig.

00:28:32.359 --> 00:28:33.759
Every variety is here.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.680
Let me give your group a name.

00:28:35.839 --> 00:28:40.039
Call it Yunmi's Five Beauties.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:43.240
No, no, no.

00:28:43.599 --> 00:28:45.119
Yunmi's Fantastic Five.

00:28:45.359 --> 00:28:47.119
Yes, yes, Yunmi's Fantastic Five.

00:28:49.799 --> 00:28:51.400
How does this male lead manage

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:53.240
to make people want to turn dark in minutes?

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:55.759
Alright, alright.

00:28:55.759 --> 00:28:56.319
Let's get down to business.

00:28:57.599 --> 00:28:58.160
Little fool.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.920
Has Big Brother visited you recently?

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.640
Big Brother doesn't pay much attention to you.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.160
My ten thousand taels are probably going down the drain.

00:29:10.319 --> 00:29:11.400
Young Master Xiu.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.559
Please don't mention Lord Yuwen in front of the princess.

00:29:15.599 --> 00:29:17.319
The princess will be sad if she hears it.

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:19.119
That's true.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.039
You are completely sincere towards Big Brother now,

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.640
but unfortunately, Big Brother he...

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:26.640
The little fool is so pitiful.

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.119
Seeing how pitiful you are,

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.200
Seventh Cousin will take you out to relax.

00:29:31.319 --> 00:29:31.799
How about it?

00:29:41.119 --> 00:29:42.240
What are you looking at, little fool?

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.039
Looking at Seventh Cousin.

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:47.319
Then tell me, what's so good-looking about Seventh Cousin?

00:29:47.319 --> 00:29:48.079
Seventh Cousin.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.119
Are we going to watch cockfights,

00:29:50.119 --> 00:29:53.119
or to the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion to see pretty girls?

00:29:53.519 --> 00:29:54.559
What are you saying?

00:29:55.079 --> 00:29:56.200
How could Seventh Cousin be the kind of

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.599
frivolous, pleasure-seeking playboy?

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:14.799
Young Master Xiu, you've arrived.

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:15.680
Please come in.

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:30.680
Little fool.

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:31.680
Play around here.

00:30:31.799 --> 00:30:32.359
Don't run off.

00:30:34.039 --> 00:30:35.079
Keep a good eye on him.

00:30:35.119 --> 00:30:35.839
Don't worry, Young Master Xiu.

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:37.000
Come, come, please come in.

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.279
Win a lot, Young Master Xiu.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.240
Come, come.

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:44.960
Two young masters.

00:30:45.319 --> 00:30:47.359
This way, this way, come, come.

00:30:47.599 --> 00:30:48.440
Please come in, please come in.

00:30:50.519 --> 00:30:51.240
Seventh Cousin.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.559
You'll get your comeuppance.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.960
Take care, sir.

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.440
Need to help the Meng Mansion

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.720
recruit some honest maids and servants.

00:31:14.319 --> 00:31:16.039
Miss, where is your father?

00:31:21.799 --> 00:31:23.160
This girl is truly pitiful.

00:31:25.359 --> 00:31:26.480
There's a place hiring maids.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.680
The monthly pay is the highest in all of Luojing City.

00:31:29.799 --> 00:31:31.279
Would you like to go?

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.720
What place?

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:37.440
At Grand Tutor Meng's residence.

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:41.559
Meng Mansion... Little Black Pig.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.079
Don't worry, miss.

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.759
The masters of the Meng Mansion are extremely good to their servants.

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:48.519
I'm only helping you because I see you're pitiful.

00:31:49.079 --> 00:31:50.039
If you agree,

00:31:50.519 --> 00:31:51.680
they will give you a sum of silver

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.559
to give your father a proper burial.

00:31:55.079 --> 00:31:55.799
What do you think?

00:31:56.599 --> 00:31:58.119
Give my Imperial Father a proper burial?

00:31:58.599 --> 00:31:59.400
I wouldn't dare.

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:01.960
Look, so many guests are here.

00:32:02.359 --> 00:32:03.680
That is absolutely no problem.

00:32:04.079 --> 00:32:04.519
Yes.

00:32:04.519 --> 00:32:06.119
If you two gentlemen want to play,

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:07.759
why not go in and take a look?

00:32:08.319 --> 00:32:08.880
Right?

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:12.400
Young Master Xiu.

00:32:12.559 --> 00:32:13.160
You've come out.

00:32:21.039 --> 00:32:21.519
Where is he?

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:24.200
Where did he go?

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.680
N-no, I don't know.

00:32:26.799 --> 00:32:27.880
Go look for him, now!

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:28.920
Yes, yes.

00:32:29.039 --> 00:32:29.519
Hurry!

00:32:34.279 --> 00:32:35.200
Starting today,

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.400
it will be you few

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.880
who will take care of the young lady's pet pig.

00:32:38.119 --> 00:32:39.359
Everyone must not be careless.

00:32:39.559 --> 00:32:40.200
Understood?

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:42.480
Follow me.

00:32:50.279 --> 00:32:52.200
Because the master disregarded the young lady's wishes

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.240
and sent her pet pig to the palace,

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.839
so to cheer up the young lady,

00:32:55.839 --> 00:32:56.559
the master ordered people

00:32:56.559 --> 00:32:58.599
to buy some similar piglets for the young lady.

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:01.000
These are the piglets you will care for in the future.

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.359
There's no black one.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.799
Color and such are just superficial things.

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.119
Can't white or pink ones become black?

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.920
Yes, absolutely they can.

00:33:19.359 --> 00:33:21.440
Girl, what number is this?

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:24.599
Two...

00:33:25.319 --> 00:33:26.240
hundred and fifty.

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.559
What a pity, truly a pity.

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.000
Auntie Fu.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.279
What are you pitying?

00:33:35.119 --> 00:33:36.039
Come quickly and greet the young lady.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.359
I was just talking about this girl.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.559
So the role Director Ling cameoed as

00:33:48.559 --> 00:33:49.720
is Meng Yinglu.

00:33:51.799 --> 00:33:53.680
It really is quite a pity.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:55.559
She looks quite delicate,

00:33:56.119 --> 00:33:57.559
just her eyesight is poor.

00:33:57.799 --> 00:33:59.119
Like my Little Black at home.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:03.200
You, what's your name?

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.000
A Lan.

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:09.719
Young lady, perhaps we should send this girl away.

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:10.320
No need.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.199
Just give this simpleton to me.

00:34:12.599 --> 00:34:14.159
It's just perfect, the mansion has been terribly boring lately.

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:22.000
Little Black.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.920
Little Black, I found you a companion.

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:32.440
Little Black.

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:36.679
Simpleton, you be careful.

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:37.960
Little Black bites people.

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:42.639
Little Black.

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:47.639
Little Black.

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:50.679
Little Black.

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:57.400
Little Black, my treasure.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:03.360
That domineering, vicious, selfish

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:04.920
and utterly inhuman Fifth Princess in the palace

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:06.639
actually dares to covet you.

00:35:07.519 --> 00:35:09.159
How could this young lady let her have her way?

00:35:10.599 --> 00:35:11.079
Simpleton.

00:35:11.679 --> 00:35:13.039
Go and fetch the pastries, quickly!

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.199
Excuse me.

00:35:21.679 --> 00:35:23.519
That domineering, vicious, selfish

00:35:23.519 --> 00:35:26.320
and utterly heartless Fifth Princess is none other than me.

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:29.320
She came to your mansion to steal a pig.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.519
Blackie, be good.

00:35:37.639 --> 00:35:38.679
Here, have a bite.

00:35:41.079 --> 00:35:42.320
You must eat something.

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:46.639
I should still ask my brother to fetch a doctor.

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.159
You fool, watch Little Black carefully.

00:36:01.159 --> 00:36:01.760
What is it?

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.159
You fed him?

00:36:10.679 --> 00:36:12.719
It seems Little Black quite likes you.

00:36:14.719 --> 00:36:16.199
From now on, you are responsible for taking care of Little Black.

00:36:17.239 --> 00:36:19.400
If you dare let him lose a single hair,

00:36:20.159 --> 00:36:21.920
you won't eat for a day.

00:36:45.199 --> 00:36:45.800
Young Master Xiu.

00:36:47.199 --> 00:36:47.760
Young Master Xiu!

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:48.320
Did you find her?

00:36:50.639 --> 00:36:51.239
We didn't find her.

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:52.719
Why did you come back without finding her?

00:36:53.199 --> 00:36:53.719
Keep looking!

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:55.079
Yes, yes, yes.

00:36:57.519 --> 00:36:57.960
This...

00:36:59.039 --> 00:37:00.800
Where on earth has that little fool run off to?

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.800
Seventh Cousin, you won't find A Lan.

00:37:38.519 --> 00:37:39.159
Why?

00:37:40.119 --> 00:37:43.320
A pig thief has come to the Meng Mansion.

00:38:11.519 --> 00:38:14.039
Just like that domineering Fifth Princess,

00:38:14.679 --> 00:38:16.639
coveting our Meng Mansion's little black pig.
