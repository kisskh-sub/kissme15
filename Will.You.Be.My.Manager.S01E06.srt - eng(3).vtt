00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:49.690
Eun Ho.

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:56.620
Si Woo.

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:01.290
I have to choose both, right?

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.600
That's a given for a manager.

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:10.280
Why ask that?

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.170
Enough of this game. No more.

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:21.730
Dopamine doesn't exist in your bodies, huh.

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:25.090
Yeah, exactly. No more fighting.

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:28.110
You shouldn't really ask anything.

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:37.320
Was Truth or Dare fun?

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.350
Yeah.

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:41.690
It was really fun.

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:46.100
Hana-chan, do you have anyone you like?

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.290
I'd rather drink soda.

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:51.890
So, there is someone.

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:54.210
I'm not telling you. Soda, please.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:55.680
My gosh, who is it?

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.890
We can't get soda now. The stores are all closed.

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:00.930
In that case... the question isn't valid!

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:04.840
Who is it? Are you keeping it from me, too?

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:08.350
It's a secret!

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.730
Wait for me!

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:30.240
The teacher's here! Come gather round!

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.530
So freaking tired.

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.470
- Are all of you here?
- Yes, sir!

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:48.910
Good morning!

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.750
You know you've got to move about
as much as you deliver your lines, right?

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:55.180
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

00:20:55.180 --> 00:21:00.230
So, let's start with a long jog.

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:01.550
Nice.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:05.080
The group that returns first gets...

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:07.910
five extra points. Five.

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:10.400
- Sounds great.
- Five points.

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:15.660
All right, run like your life depends on it.

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.450
Let's go.

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.720
Over there.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.720
Make sure you don't hurt yourself.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.360
Ready...

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:29.960
- You can do it!
- Go for it!

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.670
- Eun Ho, Si Woo! Do your best!
- Cheer them on.

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:35.080
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.650
Why is he so slow?

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:40.180
Ba Reun! Faster!

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:41.700
Run on!

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.630
You can do it!

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:46.930
- Ba Reun!
- Run!

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:49.270
Faster!

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:51.750
- Let's go!
- Nam Min Soo! Run faster!

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:54.900
Go, go, go!

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:00.400
Oh dear.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.030
Are you feeling unwell?

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:05.120
Run!

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:08.470
Well done!

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:09.870
Let's keep going!

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:12.000
Run! Quickly!

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.340
Three rounds left!

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:18.470
Oh, I didn't click it.

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:28.140
Don't force yourself! Make sure you don't get hurt!

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:38.260
Come on, only a few rounds left.

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:41.350
- Is she asleep?
- What are you doing?

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:45.700
You can do it!

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:49.820
Just admit it. When did you fall for her?

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:00.670
All done.

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:05.410
I'll also become someone you need.

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:10.280
It's been quite long.

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.890
What about you?

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.620
Hana-chan.

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:36.100
All right.

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.240
Done.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.500
So pretty.

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:51.100
[Hana, Si Woo]

[And Eun Ho]

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.740
Longer than you.

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:09.880
You're last.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.410
Last round!

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:15.040
Those two are really fast.

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:22.290
Just a little bit more!

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:28.060
Okay!

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.040
Cut, cut, cut!

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:42.560
These brats, damn it.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.090
Stop this!

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:46.700
Our group's a real mess.

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:51.550
You two aren't worthy of being in the director's film.

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:54.300
You're the worst.

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.710
Ugh, so noisy.

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:59.010
That's youth, huh.

00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:02.620
I guess. One of them should just confess their love soon.

Hana-chan.

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:20.270
What's that?

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:22.370
Show it to me!

00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:27.830
You're always smiling, you eat well, and are so brave.

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:33.450
You're considerate, pretty, and fun.

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:37.510
But why is this in Japanese?

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:44.560
To sum it up, you're the ideal girl of this lifetime.

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:51.290
- But...
- Can you answer me after giving it some thought?

So Yeon!

- What?
- Let's go to the canteen!

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:17.920

First...

Time really flies. It's already summer break.

I guess.

What are you doing this weekend?

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:48.480
Let's go on a date.

What are you going to do?

Don't you have any ideas?

Not at all.

Are you heading somewhere?

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.780
Heading out to exercise.

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:23.420
You aren't going to meet someone, right?

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:26.070
Can't you tell?

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:29.230
Okay, take care!

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:50.830
Want to meet later?

Yes!

Damn it.

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:20.110

Everyone's here. Every single one.

You're right.

In this?

What's that?

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.050
Isn't that Min Soo?

That's him.

Did the two of you prepare this?

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:41.400
I did most of it.

We did it together!

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:46.700
Hana-poof was a great help.

Enough!

00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:11.250
I thought all you did was play.

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:12.510
You worked hard filming everything.

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:14.930
Hana-poof should be an actress.

00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:17.250
You look really good on camera.

00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:23.210
- The filming's great.
- You can be the manager and Hana-chan...

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:24.990
And she can be an actress?

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:27.540
Min Soo can be the manager.

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:29.020
Min Soo as a manager?

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:31.060
No way, I should be the actor.

00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:32.930
Yes, exactly.

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:35.760
Applause!

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.700
Clap!

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.520
This is the best!

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:50.140
Nam Min Soo, you spent a lot of time filming this.

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:54.350
Hana-poof did the editing.

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:56.560
She insisted on doing it.

00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:00.520
While I was editing,

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:04.350
I was surprised by how much I laughed.

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:12.710
Everyone made me so happy.

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:15.550
I know I shouldn't be laughing.

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:18.880
But I just couldn't hold my laughter back once I started.

00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:28.560
Why shouldn't you be laughing?

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:40.180
Actually, I'm returning to Japan this week.

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:44.380
I heard that Suzu's condition is a lot better now.

00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:47.060
That's great.

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:48.950
But you won't be coming back?

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:55.010
Thank you so much for everything.

00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:01.070
You tried to understand me and accepted me.

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:04.970
That's good news.

00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:07.980
You should meet your friend.

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:11.690
In that case, let's all take turns to share our feelings.

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:15.660
Nam Min Soo, you can start.

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:17.220
Me?

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:24.320
Damn it, Hana-poof's not coming back,
but the rain's approaching.

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:27.640
The gear's crazy expensive.

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:29.270
Damn it. Guys, move it.

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:30.550
Get moving!

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:32.440
- It's freaking expensive!
- What do we do?

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:34.600
Freaking hell!

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:00.420
Hana...

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.200
Will you...

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:09.320
become my exclusive manager?

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:23.000
You once asked me what was most important to me.

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:30.900
What's the most important thing to you?

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:36.160
It's you.

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:38.900
Hana Hirose.

00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:49.510
I'll go to wherever you are.

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:34.720
When I'm with you, everything becomes a romance.

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:24.620
[Epilogue]

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:26.530
So hot.

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.380
Don't you feel hot?

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:31.300
Ugh, don't touch me!

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:34.200
Damn, she's so pretty.

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.310
- So cute.
- It's even hotter in Japan.

00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:38.720
You'll be steamed into dumplings there.

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.850
I guess Hana-chan's become a dumpling then.

00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:45.670
Let's eat something refreshing,
like cold buckwheat noodles!

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:49.050
That's even more delicious in Japan.

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:55.210
Wanna go to Japan?

00:40:56.610 --> 00:40:57.880
I'll really go.

00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.210
Fine, I'll go too!

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:00.970
- Now?
- Let's go.

00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:02.150
I'm off.

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:04.790
No, me first! Hey, wait up!

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:07.580
Wait for me!

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:10.060
We should call Hana-chan.

00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:17.920
