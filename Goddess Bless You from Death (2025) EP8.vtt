00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.480
It will happen again.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.720
The killer did everything to the victim.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.680
Just like the Tree Murders, seven victims.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.160
If a murder like this happens,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.880
it means the main suspect you arrested
is not the real killer.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.600
I want to be a real cop.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.240
Not someone’s puppet.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.640
May I go in and look at Ta Khuean’s office?

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.520
Sure.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.120
He brought dirty money in,
ran it through the place, laundered it.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.280
You think the killer is trying to find victims
to complete all seven days?

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.480
If it’s the same killer,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.960
he’s looking for seven new sacrificial victims.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.760
This is Ta Khuean’s debtor?

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.400
Yes.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.480
I’ve contacted everyone already.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.040
This is the only one I still can’t reach.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.000
No one knows where he’s gone.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.160
I tried contacting people at Santi Tham House,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.720
to see if anyone knew this man.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.680
They said Warit

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.520
often ate free meals at the soup kitchen,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.039
and often borrowed money from people
at Santi Tham House.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.600
Ta Khuean.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.600
Let me borrow some first this time, uncle.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.280
Alright, alright.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.280
Here, sign for the last round first.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.640
Where are you going?

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.360
To the end of the alley.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.960
Then let’s go together.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.560
He couldn’t keep the cash rotating.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.760
And lately, gambling too.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.240
So he stopped showing up much.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.000
Gambling at Ta Khuean’s den?

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.800
Yes.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.520
Got the address yet?

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.479
Then come with me, Sing.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.479
Ko, help follow up the warrant.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.720
Yes, Inspector.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.840
Hello. What’s up?

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.800
Someone sent a Sia-Kaban doll to Darin.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.680
It was hidden inside a figure.

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:57.360
A Sia-Kaban doll?

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.800
I’ll send photos.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.800
This place isn’t far from Santi Tham House.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.760
Hello. Anyone here?

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.560
Who is it?

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.480
I’m Inspector Sing.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.600
From the Special Investigation Unit.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.400
Thought it was a creditor.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.160
What did he mess up this time?

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.560
Nothing yet.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.520
Just here to ask for some information.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.960
May I come in and talk inside?

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.600
I haven’t heard from him for days.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.520
Didn’t you go look for him?

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.040
Why would I?

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.760
All he does is cause trouble.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.120
Only creditors ever come chasing his debts.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.600
Anything unusual about
your younger brother lately?

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.280
Recently he seemed spaced out,
like scared of something.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.560
Probably the creditors.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.880
The other day I saw him on the phone.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.160
After the call, his face went pale.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.320
He said,

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.960
I’ll find the money to pay you back.
Please don’t do anything to me.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.160
Sounded like a death threat?

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.440
Seems like it.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.200
Warit liked drawing symbols on his belongings.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.360
P'Sing.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.960
This has only a name… no sender.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.560
Help me open it.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.080
Oh no, I won’t.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.680
If you want to open it,
open it yourself.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.240
Lion Head.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.920
Wijitmawan.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.160
Mae Sue for Sunday.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.320
Last time, the Sunday pattern
was interrupted.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.920
I think

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.520
might be the next victim.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.680
Hello.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.280
Thank you.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.520
Thank you.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.080
At the scene, only a wallet
and a lighter were found.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.240
That’s all?

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.600
That’s all.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.320
V.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.520
Same as what I found at home.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.040
P'Sing.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.520
Take it. Hold on to it.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.320
What is it?

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.360
Can I try something?

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.280
Try what?

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.400
Do you remember…

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.440
the ghost that keeps appearing to me?

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.400
I think maybe he can help us.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:38.400
You’re going to talk to a ghost?

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:41.240
Aren’t you scared?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.120
Of course I am.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.160
But if this is the only way

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.280
to get evidence to keep investigating,

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.120
I’ll try.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.760
Okay.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.400
But if anything happens,

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.160
shout for me.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.560
I need your help.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.040
I’m looking for a man.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.680
I don’t know where he is.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.720
I know you’ve been watching over me all along.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.480
Can you help me again?

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.240
You know, right…

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.120
where the man P'Sing and I are looking for

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.440
is.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.320
P'Sing.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.720
He’s right behind there.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.520
So you came to check this spot

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.680
because a ghost told Thup?

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.120
If you don’t believe it, go back first.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.400
I’ll handle it myself.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.480
And another thing, I don’t believe in ghosts.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.120
But I believe Thup.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.400
Thup.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.680
Wait in the car.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.040
Yes.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.520
Inspector.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.560
We found a phone.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:48.680
Okay.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:13.800
Khem.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.320
Took you long enough to answer.

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:22.880
Bring my money back. Now.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.000
Or get ready to hand over your organs
for me to sell.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.120
Hello. Hello, hello.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.040
What are you freaking out for?

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.880
Ta Khuean’s voice.

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.160
I’ll have someone trace the phone signal.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.160
-Paijit.
-Yes.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.360
Handle the rest.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.960
Yes, sir.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.240
Sey.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:55.800
What is it?

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.000
P'Sing, when are you coming?

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.280
Darin’s in bad shape, P'.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.640
I’ll go myself.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.360
You’re going yourself?

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.600
Yeah.

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.440
Take care of things here.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.800
Don’t worry.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.280
From here on, I’ll do everything right.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.720
What’s wrong?

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.440
I’m sorry.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.320
If I’d thought of this sooner,
it wouldn’t have ended like this.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.800
Why blame yourself?

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.800
Without you, I wouldn’t have found Warit.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.800
But it was still too late.

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:07.640
Thup, listen to me.

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.359
You were a key part
in helping me find the body.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.079
People who doubted you

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:17.040
will stop calling you superstitious.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.440
Really?

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.640
Really.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.680
Then…

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:29.560
is there a reward?

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.760
That’s enough.

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:35.560
What’s this?

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.240
A wildflower bracelet.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.200
I was waiting for you…

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.040
so I made it for fun.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.080
Perfect timing.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.360
You even know my size?

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.480
Not just wrist size.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.480
Other sizes too.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.320
Pervert.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.080
Get in the car.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.160
What?

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.040
The big reward,
go get it at home.

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.360
Then let’s hurry home.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:43.360
Hey.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.080
Where’s P'Sing?

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.760
Don’t look at me like that.

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:53.440
I’m still the lead on this case.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.920
And I’m worried about you guys too.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.720
Sey, tell me what happened.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.920
Out of nowhere, a package arrived.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.520
Sent to us.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.480
Addressed to Darin.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.720
At first we thought it was a freebie.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.480
So we didn’t think much of it.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.240
But when we were about to,

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.720
You don’t need that much detail.

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.440
Just normal housework.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.960
Accidentally hit it, it fell and broke.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.720
That’s how we saw what was inside.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.320
Okay.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.600
Then I’ll check the surrounding area.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.640
To collect evidence.

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.120
Go ahead.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.920
-Ko.
-Yes.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.320
Check every package.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.520
And get the CCTV from forensics.

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:54.840
Yes.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.080
Darin.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.920
-What?
-Come here.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.200
What’s wrong?

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.920
They’ll take that crazy doll away soon.

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.680
No need to worry.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.200
I’m not worried about the Sia-Kaban doll.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.840
Then why the long face?

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.200
Just thinking about what they did to Thup
is enough to make me sick.

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.600
They threw Thup in jail
even though he did nothing wrong.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.080
Anyone can tell

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.920
it was P'King.

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:30.960
So what are we supposed to do?

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.440
We still have to rely on him, right?

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.840
I’ll send a team to watch over you two.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.080
And for now, if anything happens,

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.320
tell me.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.040
That’s not necessary. We’ll be fine.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.160
Darin.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:57.160
I know that no matter what I say,
you still don’t trust me.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:01.200
But I’ll prove it to you myself
that I truly want to protect everyone.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.040
Whether as a cop,

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.920
or as someone who used to be your friend.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:28.480
P'King.

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:30.840
Is something wrong?

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.920
Nothing.

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:48.200
The spot where Warit’s body was found
is about one kilometer from Santi Tham House.

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:51.560
Further checks found no traces
of any other bodies.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.600
As for the CCTV…

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.480
broken, as usual.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.760
If Ta Khuean is really the killer,

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.800
why would he use this place?

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.320
He could’ve committed the murder elsewhere.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.720
Maybe Santi Tham House.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.640
Since Ta Khuean could come and go easily.

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:12.280
But lately there’s been a lot of police activity there,

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.720
so he switched to using this place instead.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.400
Sey’s side has tracked Ta Khuean now.

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.840
The last signal shows

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.640
around Min Buri.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:25.160
Then spread our people to search that area.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:28.400
Have our teams ready to move
as soon as a lead comes in.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:31.200
As for the body found at the scene,

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.280
keep it under wraps for now.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.560
I don’t want the killer to catch on.

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:37.120
Yes, Inspector.

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:44.680
(Sunday)

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:48.000
(Wednesday)

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.560
What are you thinking?

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.880
Right now, I want to know…

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.400
What does the killer choose victims by?

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.520
We already know

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.080
he chooses by the seven birth days.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.040
But is there

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.600
no other reason at all?

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.920
Like Natee and Warit,

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.200
I can kind of understand.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.280
They were connected to Santi Tham House.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.560
But Darin and the kid named Jump,

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.200
they weren’t involved at all.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.760
So why were they chosen?

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.960
Or is it because of something…

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.720
occult-related or that kind of thing?

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.520
How am I supposed to understand the killer?

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.840
I need to know what he chooses victims by.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.080
Who are you? Don’t come closer.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.640
No. Don’t.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.240
Did you really take him to see a doctor?

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:09.040
Yeah. I already took him to a doctor.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.360
The doctor said he needs a lot of rest.

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.760
But I don’t get it.

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.800
He’s been sleeping all day.
Still no better.

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.760
Or did Jump really see a ghost?

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.640
A regular doctor might not help.
Maybe we need a shaman.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.960
Can you stop it already?

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:33.800
I know it, you’re making content again.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.160
I’m not playing along.

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.240
Can’t I joke around?

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.360
What about you?

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.640
Is it happening again?

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.800
Probably haven’t rested much lately.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.120
My immunity’s probably low.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.240
But whatever.

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.720
It’ll pass.

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:04.000
Take good care of yourself too.

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.880
Hey, can you,

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:08.600
grab the meds for Jump?

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.120
They’re on the table by the bathroom.

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:12.920
Don’t come in.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.560
It’s okay, it’s okay.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:25.720
Bom.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:27.800
Bom.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.680
What the hell, Bom?

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.920
What’s wrong with you?

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.640
Nothing.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.720
I saw the pill bottle and remembered
I need to take mine too.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:45.520
Yeah, that’s good.

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.200
Don’t let anything happen to you too.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.800
Jump’s already lost it.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:55.000
Don’t start seeing things too.

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:37.160
Still not asleep?

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.040
Waiting for my reward?

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.920
Is that all that’s on your mind?

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:51.920
You could say that.

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.240
You’re all that’s on my mind.

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.280
That’s too much.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.360
If you’re stressed about anything,
you can talk to me.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.800
You know I can help.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.120
Right now, I’m thinking about

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:14.160
what’s going on in the killer’s head.

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.560
Why?

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.800
If the killer in Sisaket,

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:21.360
Phang Nga, Chiang Mai,

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.000
and Bangkok is the same person,

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.280
then I want to know how he chooses victims.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.920
Because if this keeps going,

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.200
I’ll just keep chasing bodies.

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.960
I want to help them in time.

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:41.560
Then why don’t we go to the origin?

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.680
The origin?

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.360
The very first case we know about

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.360
happened in Sisaket, right?

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.760
If we go back there,

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.000
we might find the killer’s origin.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.560
Then we might figure out how he thinks.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:58.800
That sounds good.

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.240
Because when the first incident happened,

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.400
the killer had probably just started.

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.560
He wouldn’t have been this meticulous yet.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.480
If he made a mistake
and left something

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.200
behind, we might be
able to trace it there.

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.280
Uncle Chai once told me

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.200
there was a shaman there
who performed this ritual.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.080
And the Grandmaster Monk
once chanted funerals

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:22.560
for all seven victims killed by that shaman.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:26.960
I think he must know something.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.720
But…

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.360
we have to go there ourselves.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.160
Wouldn’t calling be faster?

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.480
Calling won’t work.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.240
Because that shaman…

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.600
he’s already dead.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.240
Wait.

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:48.200
So you’re going there

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.480
to talk to a ghost?

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.160
Mm. Yes.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.160
It’s been many years already, P'.

00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.440
People who know about it…

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.280
there aren’t many left.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.920
If that’s what you believe, then okay.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:08.520
I’ll clear my work quickly
and then we can leave.

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.360
Then…

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.200
does that mean…

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:20.480
you owe me two rewards now.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:22.800
For helping you with the work.

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.400
Give you an inch, you take a mile.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.480
What if I take both the inch and the mile?

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.440
Oh?

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:57.240
Did Ai Soon send you to get me?

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.000
I was just about to go anyway.

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.920
-Don’t run.
-Hey, damn it.

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.960
Don’t run.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.360
-Go.
-Go.

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:08.120
Why the hell are you arresting me?

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.320
Khuean has helped me a lot.

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.160
I’ll try to find a way to help.

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:24.520
But it has to be within the law.

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.880
Hello.

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.480
P’, we’ve found Ta Khuean.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.400
Where?

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:46.680
Santi Tham House.
The one who reported it was…

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.040
the head of the house, Ai Soon.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.560
(Santi Tham House)

00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.880
Let me go.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.480
I didn’t do anything wrong.

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.160
Shut it, Khuean.

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:06.160
Someone saw you

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.560
using donation money to run a gambling den,

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.160
-and buying yourself a big house.
-Enough.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.480
Let the police handle it.

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:16.840
I’ve heard about the case
with seven murder victims.

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:21.960
All of them were disciples
of Santi Tham House.

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.080
If there’s anything I can help with,

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.320
please let me know.

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.760
Thank you.

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:32.000
Ko, take him in for further questioning.

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.440
Up. Move.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:36.280
What are you doing? You need evidence.

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.920
-Get up.
-We’ll talk there.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.640
Do you know this person?

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.520
Yes.

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.480
What’s your relationship?

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:09.400
He’s the one who…

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.160
delivers goods, ice,

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.680
supplies to shops at Santi Tham House.

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:16.760
That’s all?

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.080
What about this one?

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.240
Heard talk about borrowing money,

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.280
about the gambling den.

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:30.720
What?

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.760
I don’t know anything.

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:38.800
And this?

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.440
It’s not mine.

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:48.360
How could it not be?

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:50.520
When we found evidence

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:53.640
in your room, and you still deny it?

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.680
Warit’s phone also has your number.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.200
If it were me,

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:01.800
I’d confess now.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.560
Might get a lighter sentence.

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:08.000
It was just…

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.600
a bit of gambling.

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:13.719
Just among acquaintances, officer.

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:15.600
And the loans?

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:18.840
Oh, there were some.

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.800
They were in trouble, so I…

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:22.520
just lent money.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.199
Lent money.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:26.600
And when they didn’t pay back,

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:30.280
-you got mad and killed them?
-Hey, kill who?

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:32.400
What is this, officer?

00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:34.840
Don’t act like you don’t know.

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:37.159
You think you’ll get away with this?

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:40.159
I don’t know.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:44.080
I admit the gambling, the lending.

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:45.960
But about anyone dying,

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.400
I know nothing.

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.199
Two days ago,

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.360
Natee Lumboriwan

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.239
was found dead in an abandoned building.

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:56.639
And yesterday,

00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:59.360
Warit Saemanotham was found dead.

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:01.240
So…

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.200
those two are dead?

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:06.800
I can put you in jail easily.

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.840
Because you’re the main suspect.

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.240
Since both of them

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:13.440
are directly connected to you.

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:15.400
From this list,

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.800
I don’t know anything.

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:20.120
I’ve never killed anyone.

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:31.240
Then what about these seven?

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:37.280
Oh, these seven.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.080
They’re disciples
who came to Santi Tham House.

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.360
Don’t tell me…

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:47.040
that the reason they disappeared

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.320
is because they were murdered.

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.280
You really don’t know anything?

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:56.200
If you don’t talk,
I can’t help you.

00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:01.520
I told you I don’t know.
I don’t know. I don’t know.

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.760
I just wanted to…

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.760
I just wanted the money they borrowed
paid back.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:12.040
I never once thought of harming them.

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.240
And over the past few days,

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:16.680
where have you been?

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:22.320
Oh, I wasn’t in Thailand. I…

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:24.240
I went to Poipet.

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:26.600
To a casino?

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:30.040
At first,

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.200
I thought you were going to…

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:35.360
arrest me for embezzlement.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:39.160
So I went to Santi Tham House to get documents
and planned to run.

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.720
But I got caught anyway.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:43.000
But about killing anyone,

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.920
I know nothing at all.

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.280
They say Ta Khuean

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:23.840
killed everyone for some ritual.
Is that true, sir?

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.040
We don’t know.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.320
Let the police handle it.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:40.120
If there’s anything you need,
please let us know, sir.

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.840
We’re willing to help fully.

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:45.320
Thank you very much.

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.640
Focus your mind.

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:53.640
Send goodwill to the departed souls.

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:09.360
You’re going to Sisaket tomorrow?

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:11.000
Isn’t that a bit too fast?

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.320
You’ve got things covered here.

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.680
I’ll go find out what really happened back then.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.320
Taking Mek with you?

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:19.520
No need.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.040
I’ve got Thup.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.000
Let Mek help you here.

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:26.440
You’re getting attached to that kid every day.

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.840
So I’m not getting my disciple back, huh?

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:31.760
Drop it.

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.920
But I’m not giving up, Sing.

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.600
Your problem.

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:40.480
If anything happens,
you report to me immediately.

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:44.720
I know.

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.840
You don’t need to rub it in

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.640
that you’re my boss.

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.640
That’s not what I mean.

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:54.160
Right now, you and I are on this case together.

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:56.280
Stop going solo.

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.640
We’re not boss and subordinate.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.560
We’re one team.

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:02.840
Okay.

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:05.680
I promise if anything happens,

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:08.520
you’ll be the first I report to. Okay?

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:27.960
Oh? Since when did you secretly buy black ginger serum?

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:32.640
Look at that, acting like you don’t need it.

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:34.840
Turns out you want to look good too.

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:36.280
You recommended it.

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:37.800
So I should use it, right?

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:40.280
These days you’re a cop
who takes care of himself.

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.000
Kinda cute, actually.

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:44.240
Stop teasing me.

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:45.640
You packed yet?

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:48.640
Right here. All done.

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:52.920
What the hell is this?

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:58.280
Isn’t this a bit much?
We’re gone three days.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.040
I promised your mom.

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:03.000
That I’d take good care of you.

00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:06.600
Okay.

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:19.120
-What are you doing?
-Normally…

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:22.360
Cops are the ones who frisk suspects.

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.640
So this time,

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.280
the suspect…

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:28.040
wants to frisk the cop.

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:30.720
Thup. Thup.

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:35.160
Pack your stuff first.

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:37.560
What is wrong with you?

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:39.840
Let me check you.

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:41.320
Ding-dong.

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.360
I’ll do a thorough search.

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.400
Go pack.

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:06.240
Go pack.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:27.040
We’re going to work, not on vacation.

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:30.080
I’m going back to my hometown too, not traveling.

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.800
Hurry up. We’re running late.

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:09.760
Just a sec, P’.

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:13.600
You forgot everything again. Even the charger.

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:15.800
I really did pack it, P’.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.480
I just forgot to grab it.

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.600
You forgot two items, ma’am.

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:24.480
May I ring you up?

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:25.520
Scan to pay, please.

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:28.360
All set.

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:30.880
-All done, thank you very much.
-Thank you.

00:42:33.895 --> 00:42:45.895
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:36.920
Done.

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:49.720
Ah, is it ready, Mom?

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:51.520
We’re having beef stew today.

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.320
Your sticky rice, right?

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.440
Yes. The kid should like it.

00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:57.120
Who’s coming?

00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:58.400
Who is it, Dad?

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.960
-Our nephew’s here.
-Thup’s here?

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.960
Oh, come on in!

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:08.560
Hello, Uncle Chai.

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:09.840
Hello, hello.

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:12.440
Oh, I’ve missed you so much.

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:14.400
Hello, Aunt Srijan.

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:15.800
Hello, dear. I’ve missed you so much.

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:17.640
How was the trip? How many hours?

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:20.040
Oh, just eight hours.

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:22.200
P’Sing was speeding.

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:24.480
No idea if he thinks he’s a race driver or what.

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:27.640
P’Sing, this is Uncle Chai.

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.320
Hello, I’m Sing.

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:30.760
Hello, dear. Hello.

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.520
-And this is Aunt Srijan.
-Hello.

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:35.720
Hello, dear. You must be tired. Come eat.

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:38.120
I cooked so much. Come on.

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:40.280
Come in, come in.

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.760
Yeah, sit down.

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:45.000
Come on, dear. I’ve been waiting.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.080
There’s eggplant soup and beef stew.

00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:49.160
And catfish with fermented fish. Eat up.

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:51.400
Wow, I didn’t make it in time to help.

00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:52.760
It’s okay, dear.

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:56.120
I remember when he was little,

00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:58.920
if he wasn’t at home,
he’d sneak into our kitchen.

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:01.160
Whatever we cooked, we’d teach him.

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:04.400
I never cooked. I always ordered.

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:07.200
I was scared I’d mess up your kitchen.

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:09.520
Now that you’re here,

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:11.960
Just show what you’ve got, Thup.

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:15.640
If I’m here, I have to try Aunt Srichan’s cooking.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:18.040
Aunt Srichan’s cooking is incredible.

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:21.960
Alright, since you’re here,
go put your bags in the bedroom.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.240
Then come down and eat together.

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:28.120
It’s okay. I’ll stay at a hotel nearby.

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:29.360
It’s okay.

00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:32.800
If you come to my house, you sleep here.
Why waste money on a hotel?

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:35.000
It’s really okay. I don’t want to impose.

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:36.840
I’ll find a place to stay.

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:39.800
Why be so considerate?

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:41.960
Considerate about what?

00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:43.440
You’re Thup’s partner.

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:45.400
Then you stay here.

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:48.600
Can you act like part of the family?

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:50.160
Come on.

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:51.760
Not yet.

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.480
Just go along with the old man.

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.480
Don’t upset your uncle.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000
Come on, let’s go.

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:02.800
Come on, carry your things inside.

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:05.480
Go on, go, go.

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:07.840
Go.

00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:38.200
Now I know where you got your neatness from.

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:39.880
Ever since Grandmaster Monk passed away.

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:43.760
Before I came to Bangkok, I only stayed
with Uncle Chai and Aunt Srichan.

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:46.560
I’m scared of ghosts,
so I didn’t really go out to see anyone.

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:51.560
So did you tell your uncle that we’re together?

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:54.600
I didn’t tell him.

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:57.080
Maybe he figured it out himself.

00:45:58.440 --> 00:45:59.440
How could he figure it out?

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:01.840
I haven’t even asked you to be my partner yet.

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:04.320
Go clear our status with your uncle.

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:12.000
And...

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.680
So what’s our status right now?

00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:22.760
No idea.

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:28.720
This kind of status.

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:31.240
Like partners, but not really.

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.240
What do you call it? A situationship, I guess.

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:44.080
So when do we get to be partners?

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.400
Thup.

00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:52.160
Finish the case first.

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:54.480
Then you and I can be official.

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:00.360
Why?

00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:02.920
Can’t wait?

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:06.160
I can wait. I don’t have a problem.

00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:09.960
Just being with you,

00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:11.960
and not seeing ghosts,

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.960
I don’t want anything else.

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:29.480
I’m going to sleep.

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:10.040
What?

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:12.040
Go to sleep.

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:16.200
Aren’t you using a blanket?

00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:58.120
Uncle already sent the location
of the shaman’s house.

00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:59.600
Thank you.

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:04.480
You already know this shaman, right?

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:06.520
I don’t.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000
But the Grandmaster Monk once said

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:10.920
there was a shaman

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:13.480
who practiced dark sorcery,

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:15.120
performing corpse rituals

00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:17.280
with seven bodies to extend life.

00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:22.000
The Grandmaster Monk warned that

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:24.000
these things are not good.

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:26.760
The longer it goes on,
the more it turns back on you.

00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:29.080
But the shaman didn’t believe it.

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:32.240
Since fifteen years ago?

00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:33.920
Yes.

00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:37.280
There was a police officer
who handled this case.

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:39.880
Out of nowhere,

00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:42.200
he lost it, went insane,

00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:43.720
and then disappeared.

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:46.360
Is it really that brutal?

00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:49.320
Everyone around here knows.

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:51.240
No one dares go near it.

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:54.960
Because everyone’s afraid it will get to them.

00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:28.880
You two, if you go into that shaman’s house,

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:30.920
be very careful.

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:32.840
Even though he’s been dead a long time,

00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:34.960
his spirit is still vicious.

00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:37.120
I’ve passed by that place before.

00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:39.600
Whenever I pass by there,

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:41.040
it feels like

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:43.000
there are still eyes

00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:45.200
full of hatred watching us.

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:47.160
Then why hasn’t he been reborn?

00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:51.480
I think the shaman’s power
is still being contained.

00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:56.080
Because he extended his own life improperly.

00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:58.760
Taking other people’s lives
to extend his own

00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:01.040
kept him from being reborn.

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:37.400
Thup.

00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:39.120
Thup.

00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:42.560
Can you wait for me outside?

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.200
Why?

00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:48.680
No.

00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:50.680
I won’t let you be alone.

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:53.600
Trust me.

00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:00.800
If anything happens, call me.

00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:27.600
You’ve got some nerve coming in here.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.680
If you come in, you die.

00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:06.360
Did you arrange to meet anyone?

00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:09.160
I’ve been clear with you all along,
and you’re still being possessive.

00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:11.000
There’s a reason to be.

00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:13.080
No idea when they’ll come
and take you back.

00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:14.960
So did you get anything more from Sisaket?

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:16.040
What I know now is,

00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:18.160
the shaman involved in the
seven-corpse ritual

00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:19.440
was a former local police officer.

00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:22.400
If he’s the culprit,
he’d know how to cover his tracks.

00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:24.240
Inspector, I found more documents.

00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:26.200
Have you heard any rumors

00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:28.280
about where Ta Khuean
might be hiding?

00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:31.800
You must’ve messed with
something bad.

00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:34.360
And people close to us get dragged in too.

00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:37.720
We’ll send word to Stark Industries

00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:40.120
that we’ve got the Mind Stone,

00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:42.000
and the future Stone as well.

00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:44.760
And this is someone
who works way too hard.

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:45.600
(Probably too hard.)

00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:48.040
Action, Mek, whoa, those eyes.

00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:50.080
(Sleeping, Inspector?)

00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:52.320
Gambling at Ta Khuean’s den like that?

00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:54.640
-Still talking about it?
-Oh, okay.

00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:57.200
So what’s our status right now?

00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:59.440
-I’m shy, don’t be so tense. I’m shy, okay?
-Don’t be tense.

00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:03.000
Just being close to you,
and not seeing ghosts,

00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:04.360
I don’t want anything else.

00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:06.880
(Just staying by your side is enough.)
