Ji Li.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.700
Ji Li,

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:31.880
I know you resent me,

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.840
but since you once saved me,

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.790
I'll protect you
for the rest of my life.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.950
Since I've given you
the Demon Pendant,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.790
I will never take it back.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.880
Your Soul-Search

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.300
left wounds still unhealed;

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.970
this pendant will let you

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.710
save the people of Hunling City.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.240
Thank you, Immortal!

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.940
Thank you, Immortal!

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.150
Many thanks, Immortal!

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.280
Thank you, Immortal!

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.560
No need for this.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.030
I am only a minor immortal;

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.470
I do not deserve such reverence.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.520
Whoever saves us,

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.590
we will build

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:21.750
a temple for them!

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:22.680
That's right!

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.400
- He's right
- Yes!

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.800
The so-called Lady Serpent Immortal

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.960
was nothing more than an eel spirit.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.520
An eel?

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.630
Using the drug to drive away Miasma

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.430
is no lasting cure.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.080
You must rely on your own,

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.520
never grow lazy,

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.710
and place no hope
on immortals or demons.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.080
That is the true way.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.400
That's not exactly right.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.750
Do you think we are in this misery

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.000
because we are lazy?

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.710
The two realms are in constant war,

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.910
and so we always suffer disaster.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.940
If we were not driven to desperation,

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.560
who would sell their labor
to an eel spirit?

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.680
- Right!
- Yes!

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.190
The great war

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.000
even rains calamity on innocent mortals.

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.890
Tomorrow,

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.730
will you truly return
to the Immortal Realm?

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:24.630
Don't forget:

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.000
You promised me you'd grow

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.630
spirit plants for the Demon Realm.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.160
Spirit plants alone

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.750
cannot end your Miasma.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.760
I believe

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.800
I can persuade Immortal Feng Tian

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.360
to share the Sun Artifact with you.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.000
Then both clans

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.920
might at last know lasting peace.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:45.590
Alright.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.120
If you wish,

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:48.680
I will try my best

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.160
to bring

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.440
this peace.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.310
I shall always wear

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.430
the Demon Pendant.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.440
Take care

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:07.470
on the way.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.390
I'll wait for you in the Demon Realm.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.160
Luo Cha.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.910
Your Grace.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.480
With the great war looming,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.390
please eliminate

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.480
Hong Zhua and Ji Li now

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.630
to cut off future peril.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.440
Your Grace,

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.160
do not repeat the same mistake.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.950
In the battle three centuries ago,

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.510
millions of demons lost their lives.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.000
Now,

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:46.680
they're using the same methods

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.920
and even the same face.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.120
Will you err again?

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.000
Still, I must keep my word.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.720
I can tell him how to cultivate
the spirit plants.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.400
Your Grace,

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.120
when you protected

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:13.830
Jin Li's shattered soul,

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.160
surely you meant to save her.

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:17.790
Today,

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.430
Ji Li is merely closer to you.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.830
If Jin Li herself

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.750
stood before you now,

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.750
could you still restrain yourself?

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.390
Even if you could,

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.560
could you erase

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.040
the past intentions to save her?

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.240
Kill me if you must,

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.240
but I must speak up:

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:49.710
Jie Chuan,

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.120
you traded all your memories

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.800
to shelter Jin Li's remnant soul

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.070
and sealed it in a fish-bone

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:58.750
inside Ji Li's body

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.600
because you wanted to dig out that bone

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.950
and summon her back.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:02.790
Now,

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.870
war is upon us.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.070
This is the best time

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.120
to kill her!

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:23.360
Ji Li.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.080
Jie Chuan,

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.190
who do you care for,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.310
Ji Li

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:55.430
or Jin Li?

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:04.830
(I'm sorry.)

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.360
(We're in different clans, after all.)

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.750
As I said,

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.190
I don't divide lives

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.160
into ranks.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.980
(May the two realms know eternal peace.)

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:50.840
(May)

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:52.600
(the two realms)

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:54.030
(know eternal peace.)

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.200
Leave me alone.

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:18.470
Ji Li,

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.510
will you let me explain?

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.030
Explain what?

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.200
Our souls are linked

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:27.790
only because Jin Li's soul dwells in me.

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:29.630
Well...

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.240
What is left to explain

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:34.390
that you'd chase me here?

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:35.720
That you tricked me

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.040
into pulling out your ice spike?

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:38.440
Or that you tricked me

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.150
into stealing a false Array?

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:41.960
Those things

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:42.960
are over, aren't they?

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:43.960
Is that so?

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:47.320
You also used me
to nurture Jin Li's soul

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.670
so you could revive her someday.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.680
Ji Li,

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.280
I never meant

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:54.120
to hurt you.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:55.920
Is that so?

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.840
You left behind a shred of her soul

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.750
so she might live again.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.320
I was never allowed to choose my life.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:07.320
I'm only a minor immortal
of feeble power,

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:09.000
but I have a name.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.320
My name is Ji Li.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.870
The Demon-subduing Immortal
is far brighter than I,

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.000
but why should I be deceived by you?

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.590
Why should I be used as a soul vessel?

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:19.960
Why should I be dragged into your epic,

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.600
heart-rending love story?

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:22.910
Ji Li,

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.960
I cut every tie long ago;

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.200
I never saw you as her.

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:30.850
Truths and lies are mixed together.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:33.120
Luo Cha can't tell them apart.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:35.000
Neither can I tell

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.670
who you love when you look at me.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:38.910
What about you?

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.670
Ask yourself:

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.360
Are you certain?

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.670
If I were only Ji Li,

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.600
would you have paused
for me even for an instant?

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.480
I saw your past with her.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.750
Every moment

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:55.150
was true.

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.840
You still have feelings for her.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.080
Then why did you take my hand?

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.670
Why shield me?

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:02.360
Why pretend

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.600
that your love was so deep?

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:05.270
Ji Li,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:06.840
that's not true.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.320
You can renew your love with her;

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.120
I don't deserve that.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.480
No need to worry about me.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.510
You want the fish bone?

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.240
You can have it back today.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:39.080
I was a fool,

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:41.630
thinking our linked souls
meant something.

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:43.480
It was nothing but a joke.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.510
No!

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.910
We shall be even

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.080
starting today.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:17.510
Jie Chuan,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.460
withdraw your Demonic Ether at once!

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.840
I've severed the soul bond
between you.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.120
Your Demonic Ether

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.240
can only harm her.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.080
Ji Li, die!

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.440
- Ji Li!
- Ji Li!

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:54.630
Don't be afraid.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:55.990
I'm here.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:57.600
Master...

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.440
Jie Chuan,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.670
Ji Li belongs to the Immortal Realm.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.390
Her fate

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:09.360
is none of your concern.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.870
If you seek to cut her bone out,

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.630
immortal soldiers will never agree.

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:19.630
Master,

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:21.960
I want to go home.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.630
(Ji Li,)

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:34.150
(I can't deny my past with Jin Li,)

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.440
(but you must know:)

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.630
(you've never been her replacement.)

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.200
(What I feel for you now)

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.550
(has nothing to do with the past)

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.120
(or your face that resembles hers.)

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:52.680
Your Grace,

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:54.320
I've brought Ji Li back

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.160
to accept your punishment.

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:03.250
Your Grace,

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:05.360
Ji Li conspired with Jie Chuan

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:06.850
and threw Hunling City into chaos.

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:08.810
Please punish her.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.040
Ji Li,

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.030
anything to say in your defense?

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.280
Your Grace,

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.630
the demons raid us time and again

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:23.000
only because the Miasma chokes them

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:25.080
and they lack sunlight.

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:27.110
I believe

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:30.440
if we can share the Sun Artifact,

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.630
the two clans can live in peace

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.810
and the mortals will know quiet at last.

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:37.990
Ji Li,

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.080
guard your tongue!

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.120
The Sun Artifact is our treasure.

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:43.720
Only by its light

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.510
are we free of Miasma.

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:48.150
Why should we share it with demons?

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:49.750
Ji Li,

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:52.120
you harbor treason in your heart.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.670
Your Grace...

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.120
Your Grace, no!

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:00.840
Master...

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:07.270
Master!

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:10.680
Master...

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:11.800
Ji Li,

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:13.970
when you freed Jie Chuan
without permission,

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:16.150
your master bore the penalty for you.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.390
Do you want to kill him now?

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:20.230
Ji Li,

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:21.470
remember:

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.080
You swore

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:24.960
to be strangers

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:27.360
with Jie Chuan

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.080
from now on.

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:49.030
I admit my guilt.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.120
Here,

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.320
I swear

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.720
that I'll never have

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.750
dealings with Jie Chuan

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:06.790
or step into the Demon Realm.

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:10.080
Should I break this oath,

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.120
let heaven strike me dead,

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.910
my soul scatter to nothing.

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:17.840
Imprison the criminal Ji Li

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.630
in the Forbidden Land.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:31.220
♪Thin wisps of smoke weave
through the river♪

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:38.180
♪Melodies and wine fade,
drunk beneath the sunset♪

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:44.900
♪Lonely light and sword shadow
sway the falling leaves♪

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:51.220
♪Laughing at my recklessness
in this life♪

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:58.580
♪You come to me in every way♪

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:05.700
♪Filling my dreams
with tangled love and hate♪

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:12.660
♪All my best years were for you♪

00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:19.460
♪At the far edge of the world
where lanterns fade♪

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:26.980
♪Through the mortal dust,
time flows with its trials♪

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:34.100
♪Joys and sorrows ease grief♪

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:39.980
♪At dusk, petals fall
as winter snow carries the starlight♪

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:46.580
♪Across endless lifetimes,
the ballad endures♪
