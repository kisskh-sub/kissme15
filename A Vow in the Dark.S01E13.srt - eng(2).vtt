Feng Tian,

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.080
=Episode 13=
we are both sovereigns.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.040
Our first duty

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.670
is to shield

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.950
our people

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.920
in peace.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.670
If you share the Artifact

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.120
and let us

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.560
cultivate spirit plants

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.700
to drive away the Miasma,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.840
I swear

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.110
we shall never have war

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:04.720
but live in harmony

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.070
with immortals.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.480
Ji Li

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.920
go hide!

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.150
The demons are attacking us!

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.350
What?

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.150
They rallied at Fengling Port!

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.710
Ji Li!

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:36.950
We parleyed for peace

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.310
to share the Artifact.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.070
This is proof.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.400
Is every demon

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.280
an oath-breaker?

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.070
Where is Jie Chuan?

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.150
War or peace,

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.120
he should speak for himself!

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.560
Who are you to question my sovereign?

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.710
Don't you have someone qualified
to confront us?

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.150
Jie Chuan, ruler of a realm,

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.310
pledged peace before every eye,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.150
yet you march without his word.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.680
You're branding him
a traitor and a liar!

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.150
The war between us

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.310
is no child's game!

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.800
Where is Jie Chuan?

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.910
Let him face me!

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.000
Where's the Sovereign?

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.400
- I didn't see him.
- Where is he?

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.000
It's all distortion.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.590
Would the Sovereign's command lie?

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.000
Did you truly think

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.120
he favored a little immortal?

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.310
Read it carefully.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.080
This command was issued

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.590
the very day of peace.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.430
All of it

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.470
is a stratagem.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:51.710
The Sovereign

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.560
used the insignificant girl

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.080
as cover

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.710
to strike the immortals at once.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.030
Ji Li,

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.360
the Sovereign grew weary
of you long ago;

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.870
everything

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.360
was mere play-acting.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.120
Today,

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.710
you shall die.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.190
After our long-lasting warfare,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.910
now,

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.520
only one road remains:

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.630
Kill to end killing.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.030
Charge!

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.870
Kill!

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.430
Ji Li...

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:08.630
Ji Li...

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:19.800
Ji Li...

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.750
Why are you here?

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.160
Ji Li,

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.800
I received the spirit plant

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.560
you planted.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.430
This time,

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:29.790
the Demon Realm

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.560
has sunlight.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:33.830
Take this back.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:34.870
You just stay here

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.070
and cultivate spirit plants.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.070
Thank you,

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.520
Ji Li.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.510
Thank you.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:44.580
Thank you.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.390
Don't sleep! Stay awake!

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.240
I can save you.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.070
It was you after all.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.630
You plotted with the demons

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.600
to feign peace.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.430
Traitor!

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.160
You're a traitor!

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.600
Ji Li...

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:29.030
Ji Li.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.800
Master,

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:51.390
our kin are dead

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.200
because of me.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.120
I placed

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.680
the weapon

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.600
in the demons' hands.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.080
Ji Li,

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:07.510
do not speak so.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:09.240
This is not your fault.

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:11.910
I know

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:14.670
you never wanted this.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.670
That child died in my arms;

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:25.790
an immortal pointed a sword at me.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:29.600
Their blood is on my hands.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.240
I brought this upon them.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:36.920
Ji Li,

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:38.870
it is not your fault.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:42.480
It will pass;

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.720
everything will pass.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.560
Master,

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.440
did you fight with Jie Chuan?

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.000
Whether he was there or not,

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:23.670
the outcome is sealed.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:29.750
Peace between the two realms

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.080
sounds easy,

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.600
yet how can you alone dissolve

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.240
three thousand years of hatred?

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:40.230
Ji Li,

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.030
you simplified everything.

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:44.750
Immortals and demons

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.240
are drenched in each other's blood.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.120
In this war,

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.680
there is no justice

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.440
but the outcome.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.960
Do you know this?

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.150
A soul-devouring aura.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.150
The soul-devouring aura

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.750
drains only immortal power.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.240
Can't you see who he is?

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:34.240
He's indeed here.

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:39.440
Ruins have turned to ash;

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.630
the battle nears its end.

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:44.480
Between the immortals and Jie Chuan,

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.450
one must fall.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:03.680
Ji Li,

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:04.870
the drop

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.120
of Jin Li's essence I kept

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:08.750
can give you strength

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.840
to stand against Jie Chuan.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.440
Master...

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.240
Most immortals can't fight anymore.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:17.960
My power

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.000
is also drained.

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.150
The fate of our people

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:24.720
rests on your choice alone.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:29.480
Did you truly think

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.320
he favored a little immortal?

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:34.320
Read it carefully.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:35.960
This command

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.440
was issued

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.510
the very day of peace.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.080
All of it is a stratagem.

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:43.350
The Sovereign

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.600
grew weary of you long ago;

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.990
everything

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.550
was mere play-acting.

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:56.420
Ji Li,

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:58.780
will you fight for the immortals

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:00.580
to the death?

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:44.540
I'm willing

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.580
to give my life for the realm.

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.100
Where is Ji Li?

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:28.860
Jie Chuan,

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.020
you're finally here.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.180
Ji Li...

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.500
Countless immortals
and demons are dead.

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.140
Are you here

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.580
to finish the immortals?

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:42.540
Ji Li,

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.180
why have you become like this?

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:50.780
On the first day,

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.260
I was struck unconscious
at Fengling Port;

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.420
all I wanted was for you to stop it.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:03.820
On the second day,

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:05.900
I saw corpses blanket the ground;

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:08.140
the immortals I lived beside

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.980
now hate me to the bone.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.780
I forgot whatever promise you once made.

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:15.860
On the third day,

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:18.340
I finally understood

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.420
how laughably naive I was

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.580
to trust you again and again.

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:26.980
It took you only three days

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.420
to turn me into this.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:31.340
Ji Li...

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.580
I waited for you every single day.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:37.460
Now, you're here.

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.100
Why don't you strike?

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.360
I am no longer the little immortal

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.420
who once dreamed of peace

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:44.660
between the two realms.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.260
Jie Chuan,

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.860
all I want now is to kill you

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.620
and avenge the dead.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:55.620
I came too late.

00:15:58.540 --> 00:15:59.380
Is that so?

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.300
You taught me

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:05.620
that immortals and demons
are no different.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:07.820
If my death at your hand

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:10.220
can make both sides
lay down their hatred,

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:13.900
I will die for your wish.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:16.180
I failed you.

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:18.500
Kill me.

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.020
The immortals have
nowhere left to retreat.

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.260
Even if I fall today,

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.780
I will not step back.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:29.700
You're wrong about one thing:

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:31.920
Immortals and demons are different.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:34.660
Today, I finally understand that.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.060
This thing between us

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:50.620
should never have existed.

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:15.460
Jie Chuan,

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:17.620
if you still want war,

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.140
the immortals will not yield.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:23.780
The demons

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:25.340
will withdraw.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:39.500
