[The Unclouded Soul]

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.810
[Episode 3]

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.630
My Lord,

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:40.039
turn it.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.120
I meant turn the map, not you.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.850
She's planning to flee.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.370
She is indeed planning to flee.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.400
But she intends

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.360
to clean out our Demons' Valley
before she runs away.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.140
Why does she want to steal carrots?

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.070
That's ginseng.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.570
She even wants to steal
the mushrooms, too.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:20.520
That's lingzhi.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.720
You must protect

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.760
this snow lotus at all costs.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.050
Please rest assured, My Lord.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.980
The snow lotus is absolutely safe.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.150
Because what Xiao Yao wants to steal is

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.460
the cordyceps.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.910
She is acting way too wildly.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.540
I must give her a serious punishment.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.680
A serious punishment.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.010
There's one more thing.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.079
The red-thread demon

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:52.870
lost a pair of red matchmaking threads.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.600
I've already checked
all the little demons,

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.890
but so far,

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.920
there's been no mismatched couple.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.880
Those matchmaking threads are

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.940
no big deal.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.970
Why are you here?

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:30.970
Are you looking for this?

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.570
My h-head hurts.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.000
I feel so dizzy.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.410
I'm afraid I won't be able
to attend classes for the next few days.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.020
Is that so?

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.920
Let me treat you.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.150
What on earth have I done to offend you?

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.600
Why are you teasing me like this?

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.660
So you noticed that I was teasing you.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.790
You...

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.040
Before the second phase ends,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.800
you should just
have a good rest in this hut.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.329
Don't go to class anymore.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.710
Hold on.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.890
How long will the second phase last?

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.510
It could be as short as 3 to 5 days,

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.100
or as long as 10 days to half a month,

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.100
depending on how well we're in sync.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.000
No, no, no. Wait!

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.400
I don't agree with this.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.360
You told me to learn quickly
and return to the human world,

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.220
but now you're confining me here?

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.920
If you don't let me go, I'll go anyway.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:19.720
I don't believe

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.870
you'll follow me every day,

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.730
giving up your cultivation time.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.970
How about this?

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.810
Let's make a deal.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.000
I'll allow you to attend classes
on Moon-Gazing Terrace,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.150
but you must focus on your cultivation.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.250
If you can make it,

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.950
I'll give you anything marked on this map.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.640
As much as you want.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.840
For real?

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.830
For real.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.659
You just need to remember

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:44.120
not to cause trouble again

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.350
or mess up the order of Demons' Valley.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.110
That's a deal.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.170
This time, I must teach that bamboo

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.290
a good lesson.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.510
Digging up some bamboo shoots

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:57.720
won't hurt him much.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.820
If humans got him,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.360
they'd uproot the whole bamboo!

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.830
Yeah.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.370
Xiao Yao, listen.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.000
Humans are terrifying, you know?

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.130
Back then, they claimed

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.750
to love beautiful, blooming flowers,

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.040
but they always cut off our roots,

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.900
making us unable to grow anymore.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.330
I endured decades
of trials and tribulations

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.510
and just gained consciousness,

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.440
only to nearly get killed by humans.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.040
To survive

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.560
and keep humans from discovering me,

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.510
I had to

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.940
shed my petals one by one,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
struggling until I could transform
into human form.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.200
Humans are two-faced

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.140
and ruthless.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.130
My mom said

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.560
that they fed and kept us well,

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:35.240
but every once in a while,

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.270
they'd put red ribbons
on the best of our ancestors

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.330
and take them away.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:39.890
Not until one day

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.960
when my mother witnessed

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.190
my grandfather being butchered by humans

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.750
did I realize

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.800
that our ancestors who never returned

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.360
had all been slaughtered by humans!

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.830
Yeah!

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.070
After that,

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.850
my mother kept me starving every day.

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.750
Sometimes I felt so dizzy due to hunger

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.530
and couldn't even see my mother clearly.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.590
But she said she was trying to save me.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.290
One year, when humans suffered famine,

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.830
that family sent us all
to the butcher's place.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.430
I was terrified at that time!

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:08.440
It was my mother.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.240
My mother frantically charged forward

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.120
and rushed out,

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.480
risking her life to shove them away

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.720
and even smashing the pigpen,

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.180
so I could finally escape.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.990
Later,

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.070
I wandered around aimlessly

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.360
until I ate some divine herbs.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.800
I had my powers grow gradually

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.120
and finally transform
into human form.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.340
Someday,

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.680
after I drink the Yuli Spring,

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.010
I will find those humans

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:28.800
and seek justice for my family.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:29.310
Mm!

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:29.870
Mm!

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.950
Actually,

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.520
humans,

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:37.600
just like demons,

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.240
also have good guys
and bad ones among them.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:42.510
Humans are more terrifying, though.

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:43.570
You three...

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.430
My bamboo shoots!

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.990
Run!

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:56.690
Run quickly!

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.030
Luoluo! Dali!

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.100
Come over here!

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:01.420
I-If I catch you,

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.970
I'll...

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.000
You...

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.950
Stop right there!

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:06.760
Stop running!

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:09.430
Come here!

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:12.540
Stop...

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.020
Stop...

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.240
What is her true form again?

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:19.630
It's a bird.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.600
No, it's a snake!

it's fine that you got wounded,

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.250
but don't drag me down with you.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.880

your face or your life?

But if life is not in danger,

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.230
then face is certainly most important.

Compared to you,

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.500
who would be stronger?

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:03.090
There's no chance to compare.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:05.590
They were all ancient mythical beasts.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.580
They perished in the war against humans.

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:10.750
To commemorate them,

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.050
the demons carved their images
on the mountains.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.630
Their physical bodies
already perished 10,000 years ago.

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.630
So humans and demons
have been fighting for so long.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:58.270
What?

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:03.920
My Lord,

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:06.890
I specially made
this roasted bamboo shoot for you.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:08.680
Please give it a try.

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:12.420
It's really palatable.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.600
How does it taste?

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.570
Not bad, huh?

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:30.320
Mm.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.640
Please don't keep this scar.

00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:59.030
It will heal soon.

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:06.360
My Lord,

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.240
could you teach me

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.000
that bubble spell?

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:13.160
As long as you practice diligently,

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.760
you'll pick up
way more than this in the future.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:16.630
But

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.630
the progress in class is too slow.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.890
When will I be able to master it?

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:23.450
As long as you're focused on studying

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:26.080
instead of digging bamboo shoots,

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.550
tricking turtles for their shells,

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.550
or coveting wolf fur and deer antlers,

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:32.880
you'll eventually get the hang of them
with daily practice.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.000
I have a question for you.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.870
Is it true that when you reach
the highest level of cultivation,

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:37.440
you'll become free from all desires

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.770
with no demand for food or drinks anymore?

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:40.440
Sure.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.690
Then I'd rather not cultivate too well.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.320
Otherwise, everything would taste bland
when I return to the human realm.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.050
That would be such a loss for me.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.100
You look so handsome when you smile.

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:01.700
Why don't you smile more often?

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.800
Is it because you've
suffered too much in the past?

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.000
The eight sufferings of life,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.530
I've experienced them all.

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:13.560
What eight sufferings?

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.720
Birth, aging, sickness, death.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:20.870
Separation from the beloved.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:22.200
Prolonged resentment.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.620
Unfulfilled desires.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.610
Inability to let go.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:28.310
You've been through all of them?

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:41.150
Have a good rest.

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.640
Looks like I made him recall
something sad again.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.150
This old demon.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:56.740
Today,

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.490
we're going to talk
about the nine-tailed fox first.

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:03.080
It's a fox-shaped beast

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:06.480
with four legs and nine tails.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:08.390
It devours humans.

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:10.790
Eating their flesh

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:13.250
can ward off evil.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.070
Do you know that?

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.440
The red-thread demon's...

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:20.840
His red matchmaking threads are
still missing.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.560
He's almost losing his mind
due to anxiety.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.390
Really?

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.390
So you know
about the red matchmaking threads, too?

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:30.720
It's common knowledge.

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:32.390
Don't tell me you don't know.

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:35.870
Of course I know.

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.270
The red matchmaking threads
have three phases.

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:40.120
In the first phase,

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.270
the couple cannot be
more than 10 feet apart.

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:42.960
In the second phase,

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.750
the couple shares feelings and senses.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:46.680
As for the third phase...

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:56.920
Do you really know?

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:01.170
Next,

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.080
let's move on

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:06.870
to ancient sayings.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.520
"Water flows from high rocks

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.510
and runs westward
to merge into the river."

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:14.600
Pair cultivation?

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:17.750
What is pair cultivation?

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:54.190
Seems like you're giving up
on untying the red threads.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.670
I don't want to do pair cultivation!

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:05.510
No pair cultivation! I refuse!

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.150
How can we untie the threads
without doing it?

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:08.360
I know everything now.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.220
Don't try to take advantage of me.

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.500
What do you even know?

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.840
You planned this in the first place,

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.570
all for this final step, right?

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:18.000
Shady demon, old monster.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:18.630
You wicked demon!

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:19.660
You're so evil!

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.560
You were the one who wrapped
the red threads around my hand,

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.020
causing all this trouble.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.600
I...

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:26.870
I still refuse to do pair cultivation!

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:28.540
I don't want it.
I don't want pair cultivation.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:29.840
I'm an unmarried damsel.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.900
I won't do pair cultivation with you!

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.200
The sooner we finish,
the sooner we break free.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.190
Let me go!

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:41.540
Let go of me!

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.840
No pair cultivation!

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:46.030
I refuse.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.250
Are you ready?

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:51.700
I'm asking if you're ready.

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:52.670
No, no, no.

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:53.870
I'm not ready. I'm not.

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:54.870
I'm not prepared.

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:56.760
The third phase

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.750
requires both parties
bound by the red threads to work together

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:00.210
and master the same spell.

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.170
This is demons' pair cultivation.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:03.960
Just this?

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.079
What did you think it was?

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:07.720
Well, then...

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.380
Which spell will we practice?

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:12.839
You're no more than a beginner.

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:14.700
And my power is still recovering.

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:16.550
Let's practice the simplest one,

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:17.680
the Fire Technique.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:18.160
Okay.

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:27.829
I'll teach you the incantation now.

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:29.920
Do I have to recite an incantation?

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.400
Can't you just transfer
your spiritual power to me?

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.260
Then I'd pull it off right away...

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:43.750
Try again.

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:49.510
I got it. It's the right hand.

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:54.440
Once more.

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.790
She's naughty and unruly.

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:23.420
For rapid cultivation,

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:25.690
one must experience
joy, anger, sorrow, and fear

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:26.820
to really master it.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.590
I can't get the hang of it.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.220
It's such a simple spell,

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.960
yet you're so lame,

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:47.000
failing to learn
after hundreds of attempts.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.350
Forget about demons;

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.070
even among humans,

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:51.800
you're a complete fool.

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:53.510
Utterly hopeless.

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:55.290
Who are you calling a fool?

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:56.510
I think you're the incompetent one.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:58.310
You can't even break a single red thread!

00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:59.160
And you call yourself Demon Lord?

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.680
You should step down
and let someone else take over.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.370
Anger achieved. Good.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.540
Stop there.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.130
Try again.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.870
There's fire! I've mastered it!

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:16.070
Joy achieved as well.

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:23.660
I told you I couldn't pick it up.

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:24.940
You're fooling me.

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:26.470
Look,

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.420
even God is not on your side.

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:38.350
Sorrow achieved.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.770
What happens
if we fail at pair cultivation?

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:51.400
Hey.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.070
Hey!

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:55.170
What do you think will happen?

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:57.770
Don't you know the result?

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:01.250
I don't know!

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.020
If we can't untie the threads,

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:04.500
you and I will become one.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.510
You'll end up in my stomach.

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:09.260
No! No! No!

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.960
No!

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.220
Fear achieved as well.

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:16.790
I've got it! Look!

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:18.350
I've mastered it.

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:19.950
It doesn't extinguish.

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:28.040
They've been removed! Finally!

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.880
Fear is

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:50.750
the best way to control people's minds.

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:52.960
Only when they fear you

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.720
will they respect you.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.870
When the full moon rises,

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:59.490
I will take you to have a test
in the human world.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:02.000
Whether you're focused on your studies now

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:04.760
will determine if you can survive that.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:07.760
Xiao Yao,

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.770
don't you know humans the best?

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.740
Luoluo and I will rely on you then.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.370
Thank you.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.210
Any unusual human activities?

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:25.160
The Feiyu Guards are
encouraging human demon hunters

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.820
to search for demons
with high spiritual power.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.920
They say,
regardless of status or background,

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.480
whoever captures a great demon

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.640
will receive generous bounties
and high official positions.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.700
This is clearly aimed at you, My Lord.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.340
Now that your wounds are healing,

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:40.680
you must train hard

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:42.770
and stop focusing on Xiao Yao.

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:46.640
A battle with the Feiyu Guard
is inevitable.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.040
There's no need to avoid.

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:49.930
With my current cultivation,

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:51.600
I can deal with them easily.

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:53.000
Xiao Mu.

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:56.490
What has Hei Wu been up to lately?

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:58.670
Hei Wu?

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:00.930
He hasn't made any moves yet.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.620
But his subordinate Wu Huan is

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:04.790
arranging for all the minor demons
at Moon-Gazing Terrace

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:06.480
to take a test in the human realm.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.200
Take a test.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:10.470
A reward.

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:14.560
This is my personal possession.

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:15.290
You will soon

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:16.850
take a test in the human realm.

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:18.250
If you encounter danger,

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.880
hold this jade pendant tightly

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.250
and call me with your thoughts.

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:22.830
Will you definitely appear?

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:24.230
Sure, I'll keep you safe.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.000
Okay.

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:27.720
That's all.

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:42.550
As I said,

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.240
only in times of danger.

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:49.070
The village below
is called Lantern Village.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.270
Humans think hanging lanterns
can ward off evil

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:53.930
and protect them from demons.

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.160
Utterly ridiculous.

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:57.030
This village

00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:59.160
is the testing ground for your trials.

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:01.310
What you need to do

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.300
is to find a household,

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:05.310
then

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:07.440
frighten a child to tears,

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.410
and bring back a pillow.

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:12.960
And you'll pass the test.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.070
That's too difficult.

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.960
And we have to take a pillow?

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:15.830
They're all asleep.

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:17.890
I mean, taking their pillow, really?

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.220
Remember, no matter what happens,

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.200
before the first rooster crows,

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:25.990
you must return here.

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:26.840
Understand?

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:27.590
Got it.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:28.480
Got it.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.030
Yes.

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:30.630
What if we can't make it back?

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.380
If there are no questions,

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.300
the test begins.

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:36.350
A head start?

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:37.550
Xiao Yao, wait for us!

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:38.350
Xiao Yao!

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:45.650
My Lord,

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:47.740
when do we make our move?

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:49.480
No rush.

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:53.100
Catching these few minor demons

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:56.990
would be a waste of such a big operation.

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.940
This pillow-stealing folk trick

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:06.550
is something I mastered as a child.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.110
Fellow demons,

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:10.590
farewell.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:12.970
Xiao Yao!

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:14.310
Xiao Yao!

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.410
Xiao Yao!

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:16.850
Xiao Yao.

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:17.550
Xiao Yao.

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:21.310
I...

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:22.000
Xiao Yao,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.680
just thinking about our past experiences

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:24.940
makes our legs go weak—

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:25.780
let alone

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.200
trying to scare humans.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.880
It's fine. Humans aren't scary.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:29.900
Go on, hurry up.

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:30.880
Look,

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.550
Luoluo is so scared
he's practically speaking pig language.

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:34.310
Xiao Yao,

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:36.440
aren't you the best
at dealing with humans?

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.790
Could you help us two?

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:38.650
Please.

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:49.600
You two wait for me here.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.200
Thank you, Xiao Yao.

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:54.830
Hurry, hurry.

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:56.440
Let's hide, come on.

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:43.950
Why isn't she back yet?

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:45.640
Could something have happened?

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:46.270
Impossible.

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:47.270
Xiao Yao is so clever.

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:48.530
Nothing will go wrong.

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:53.390
Xiao Yao!

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:55.110
Got it.

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:55.970
Thank you.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.350
Let's hurry and go.

00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.900
Let's go.

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:01.160
You go ahead.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.860
I need to go back for my pillow.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.120
-We'll wait for you.
-Xiao Yao, be careful.

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:16.200
Why did the demon-subduing talisman

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.680
mistake me for a demon just now?

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.710
Could it be true, as Hong Ye said,

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:23.590
that I've been tainted
with demonic energy,

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:26.160
which will bring deadly trouble
to my dad and me

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.310
and make me unable
to return to the human realm?

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:30.240
Help! Someone, come quickly!

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.400
Catch demons! Catch demons!

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.510
Luoluo!

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:38.570
Come here quickly!

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:39.710
Come here!

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:41.030
Where are they?

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:41.480
Where?

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.080
Over here!

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:43.790
Hurry!

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:45.520
Coming! Coming!

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:46.550
Catch him! Quick!

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:47.400
Don't let him escape!

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.660
Don't let him get away!

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:50.640
Quick! Over here!

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.480
It's over here!

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:52.180
Catch him!

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:54.550
Where do you think you're going?

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:56.350
Where do you think you're going?

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:58.790
Tie him up!

00:27:58.790 --> 00:27:59.480
Tie him up!

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:00.000
Hold him down!

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:00.880
Pin him down!

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:05.030
Tie him up!

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:06.480
Hit him!

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:08.200
Beat him!

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:09.670
Xiao Yao!

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:12.240
Xiao Yao! Luoluo...

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:14.570
Luoluo has been captured!

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.920
Go that way.

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.050
No humans are there.

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:19.430
What about Luoluo?

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:21.520
I'll figure something out. Go.

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:27.870
Where do you think you can go?

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:35.340
Run if you can!

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:38.010
Behave yourself!

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.930
See if you dare to run again!

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.140
Look at his fat face and big ears.

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.270
Eating him will surely be nutritious.

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.200
Leave the pig ears to me.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:52.730
We've got something
to go with our drinks now.

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:01.570
He's still grunting here.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:03.550
What is this?

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:04.160
Pillow.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:12.510
Sir.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:16.890
Two pillows.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.610
Remember, doing too much
leads to more mistakes.

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.010
Being too showy will also cost you points.

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:30.510
Bamboo.

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:32.240
I asked for one,

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.350
yet you gave me two.

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:35.350
Lowest grade.

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:36.110
Well...

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:37.440
I...

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:42.880
Who else hasn't returned?

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:43.550
Xiao Yao.

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:44.550
And Luoluo.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.000
Dali hasn't come back either.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:46.920
Sir!

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:48.310
Sir!

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:51.910
Luoluo has been captured by humans!

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.000
At this hour,

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.440
he must be in the cooking pot by now.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.160
Shut up!

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.240
Where's Xiao Yao?

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.480
Xiao Yao has gone to save him.

00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.830
But she's all alone.

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:01.030
There are so many humans.

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:02.030
We need to go help her.

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:02.480
Hurry!

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:04.790
No rush.

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:07.330
The test isn't over yet.

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:09.480
If they want to survive,

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:12.310
they'll have to
rely on their own abilities.

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:14.240
Then they'll really end up in the pot.

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:14.970
At daybreak,

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:16.480
we'll beat drums and gongs

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.070
and go to the magistrate's office
for our reward.

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:19.750
Let everyone for miles around know

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:21.240
that we have real skills!

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:21.790
Right!

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:22.270
Yes!

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:23.510
Bring the black dog's blood!

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:24.320
Here.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.790
Xiao Dadan,

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:41.570
your life ends here.

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.540
Xiao Dadan,

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:51.030
your sins of killing are too great.

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:53.310
Cheating and swindling all day long.

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:54.890
I have come today

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:59.510
to make you pay for your debts.

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:05.760
Nonsense!

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.520
I've never killed anyone!

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:09.270
How can you say
my sins of killing are great?

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:10.930
Don't try to play tricks here!

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:13.510
We even catch demons!

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:20.960
Today, I will seek justice from you all!

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:29.390
Spare me!

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:30.200
Have mercy!

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:30.790
We...

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:31.960
We know we were wrong.

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:33.240
We'll never dare to do it again!

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.000
Please spare us!

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:34.870
Never again!

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:37.420
I beg you to spare me!

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.110
Have mercy!

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:43.920
Please let us go!

00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.160
Don't let him escape!

00:31:59.160 --> 00:31:59.720
Boss!

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:00.400
Boss!

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:01.370
He's a demon!

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:02.830
Splash him with black dog's blood!

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:03.310
Splash him!

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:04.960
I'm going for it!

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:08.640
Let's go, come on!

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:18.720
My Lord.

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:27.030
This fluorite powder
is colorless and odorless.

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:29.090
Neither humans nor demons can see it.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.750
Only fluorescent light can reveal it.

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:36.160
My Lord, you're indeed brilliant.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.110
This time,

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.640
I'll let these minor demons

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.500
lead us to the lair of the great demon.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.050
Who hasn't turned in their pillow yet?

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:53.170
Didn't you already submit yours?

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:53.680
Yes.

00:32:58.510 --> 00:32:59.720
You three, right?

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:02.330
Just those two.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.640
It was such a simple task,

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:10.070
and you two not only failed to complete it

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:11.680
but also brought trouble upon yourselves.

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.640
You're utterly foolish

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:13.970
and beyond redemption!

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:15.870
Go to Pipa Cave immediately,

00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:16.880
and without seeing daylight,

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:17.940
reflect for a year.

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.480
It's just a test.

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:24.480
We failed, and we'll accept punishment.

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.510
Even a beating would be fine.

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:26.640
But why solitary confinement?

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:27.880
Failing the test is a minor issue,

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:30.010
but you two exposed your whereabouts,

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:32.920
putting every fellow disciple in danger.

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:36.970
It's not Xiao Yao's fault.

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:39.000
I'm the one
who brought trouble to everyone.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.340
If I could choose again,

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.880
I would still save Luoluo.

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:43.240
In the rules of the Demons' Valley,

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.370
isn't life more important than a test?

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.240
Please give me a chance
to retake the test.

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.550
Since when has the Demons' Valley
ever allowed retakes?

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:52.150
Those rules weren't there
from the beginning.

00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:54.030
If I fail the retake...

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:56.370
Yeah.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.740
We're willing to accept any punishment.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:01.960
Count me in too.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.270
Xiao Yao gave me my pillow,

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:06.200
so I should retake the test as well.

00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:10.960
Are you sure?

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.550
Yes.

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:14.190
Bring back 3 human heads.

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:18.280
And you'll pass the test.

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.630
No harm has ever been done to humans
in the tests of the Demons' Valley,

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:22.190
let alone murder.

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:22.550
Yeah.

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:23.630
This goes against our rules.

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:24.400
Rules?

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.400
Retakes aren't in the rules either.

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.230
When he was nearly killed just now,

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:29.400
you were willing to risk yourself

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.400
rather than kill humans to save him.

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:32.360
Xiao Yao,

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:34.610
since you care so much for humans,

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.920
does that mean your loyalty
is no longer with the Demons' Valley?

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:44.920
You smell of the outside world.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:57.630
What's this?

00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:58.360
Footprints.

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:01.850
All the way over there.

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:08.620
Lift your foot.

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:10.740
Lift your foot!

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:17.070
Her footprints.

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:18.200
They're identical.

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:19.810
Where did it come from?

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:21.110
I don't know where I picked it up.

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:22.340
I don't know.

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:23.070
What is this?

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:24.440
This is fluorite powder.

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:25.440
Fluorite powder?

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:29.630
You've left a trail
from the human realm to the demon realm.

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:30.280
Xiao Yao,

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:33.320
are you trying to lead humans
into the Demons' Valley?

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:33.880
What?

00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.260
So the key to this barrier

00:35:58.290 --> 00:35:59.620
is the fluorite powder.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.570
Such a precious land

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:04.280
has been occupied by a bunch of demons.

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:05.340
Truly detestable.

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:07.230
My Lord.

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:08.230
For this expedition,

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:09.670
we have the imperial divine weapon.

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:10.710
Let's end this quickly

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:11.960
by forcing that great demon out.

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:13.510
The divine weapon is too destructive.

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:14.440
Once activated,

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:17.080
this precious land will be ruined.

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:18.230
My Lord.

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:20.320
Since His Majesty
has bestowed the divine weapon,

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.710
he wants us to eliminate all evil.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:43.690
