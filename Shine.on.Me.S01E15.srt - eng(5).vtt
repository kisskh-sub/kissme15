we'd just take the train back together.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.220
meaning 30 kilowatt-hours per hour?

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:27.980
Right.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.540
At least when the sunlight is strong.

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:31.580
And how do you handle it

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.500
when there's not enough sunlight?

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.220
It's equipped
with a ground-source heat pump,

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:36.159
so we can run an energy storage cycle

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.140
and store the excess electricity

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:37.840
for later use.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.320
A GSHP energy storage system?

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.960
Could you tell me more about that?

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.039
Certainly.

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:44.159
Hold on,

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.180
let me jot this down.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.140
I also wanted to ask

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.220
about the costs.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:00.600
Mr. Wei?

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.460
Our system is quite complex.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.200
As for the costs,

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.400
I'll have to check with Finance.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.080
Why don't you leave your contact info,

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.200
and I'll send the materials

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:10.760
to you?

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:12.240
Sure.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:13.980
Are you on WeChat?

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:14.720
Let's add each other.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:22.680
The garden is gorgeous.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.640
Mind if I grab a few shots?

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:26.300
Not at all. Go right ahead.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:31.820
I'm on WeChat.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:32.740
Let me scan you.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:33.740
Perfect.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:37.000
Alright.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:38.640
I'll get everything together

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:39.080
and send it over.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:40.680
Thanks. Got it, you're added.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:41.360
Alright.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.260
Wait, isn't he your boss?

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.900
You're making your boss carry your bag?

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.040
Is that really okay?

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:56.760
Well, in our company,

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.320
it's all about project ownership.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.060
And since I'm the lead on this one,

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.500
Mr. Lin is basically just my assistant
for now.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.200
No big deal.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:03.960
He is modest to a fault.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.300
You have a great culture there.

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:11.920
Now I see why your boss

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.720
went with such a quirky phone case.

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:25.080
Thank you for your time.

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:26.500
We'll get going then.

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:27.600
Thanks.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.120
Don't mention it.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:29.840
Okay.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:44.540
Mr. Wei,

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:46.200
you engineers

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.360
are so tunnel-visioned.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:48.520
You really didn't catch that?

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:49.760
Catch what?

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:50.740
I mean,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:51.940
he was carrying her bag.

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:55.320
But on second thought,
I guess it's normal.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:56.680
Mr. Wu

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:57.860
did the same for me once.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.060
No need to make a fuss.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:01.060
Let's leave it at that.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:01.900
I'm off the clock.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:12.460
You could've just asked

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:13.620
our tech team

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:14.180
about the energy storage stuff.

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:17.680
True.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.400
But there's

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.280
a slight difference here.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:24.220
What is it?

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.920
I was discussing the garden design

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.500
with the tech team the other day.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.240
They asked so many questions,

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:33.260
I felt like

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.320
such a

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.720
clueless amateur.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.160
So I thought

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:38.820
I'd do some learning.

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:40.180
By asking an outsider,

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:41.200
I won't have to look so clueless

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.300
to the rest of the office.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:43.920
Once I get back,

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:44.840
I'm actually gonna pick up

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.820
some books on photovoltaics

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:46.840
and just nerd out in my dorm room.

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:48.140
Fair point.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:49.580
Save your money.

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:50.400
I'll let you have mine.

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:51.280
You've got them?

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.220
You bet.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:54.800
Remember,

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:55.550
I started out

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:56.560
as a Deputy GM who didn't know jack.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.420
I spent my nights grinding in secret

00:11:58.840 --> 00:11:59.440
just to look like

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:00.960
I knew what I was doing.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.340
Changing lanes is an uphill battle

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:05.780
every step of the way.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.120
Just because

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.240
you were struggling

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.020
doesn't mean you have to

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:10.980
drag me down with you.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:12.860
That's so cynical.

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:14.940
We're growing together, okay?

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:21.960
Gee, I'm touched.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:24.360
No worries.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:25.380
Okay.

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:27.120
Now that the work is done,

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.300
what should we do now?

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:29.980
Let's get back to the questions
from this morning.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.120
The Dafo Temple?

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:32.300
Canton Tower?

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:33.240
Chimelong?

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:34.700
Or let't just hit everything

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:35.660
on the must-eat list?

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:36.920
I'll go with D.

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:40.980
Let's dig in.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:44.920
How is it?

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:45.980
Seven points for ten.

One hundred and seventy.

Here you are.

Thanks.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.020
You seem to be judging

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:45.860
my phone case.

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:47.420
This was my childhood idol.

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.000
I am not.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.080
But,

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:53.420
your idol is a monkey?

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.060
It's the Monkey King.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.020
He's just drawn it a bit rounder

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:03.900
and with bigger eyes.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.380
But look,

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.280
here behind his ear

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.200
is the Golden Cudgel.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:07.940
That identifies him.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.340
I see it now.

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:12.680
I thought it was a monkey

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:13.840
from Mount Emei

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.280
that had snatched a cigarette
from a tourist.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:17.860
My apologies, Monkey King.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.280
I failed to recognize your greatness.

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:21.440
Wait.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:22.280
It's the drawing

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.400
on this phone case.

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.600
Why did they make him

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:27.260
look so round, squishy,

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:28.540
and so fluffy?

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.500
Seriously, every animal on the cases

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:31.640
you buy, has zero neck.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:32.620
I...

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:35.600
Let's drop it.

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:39.600
I can't believe

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.140
the Monkey King is your idol.

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:43.440
In the "Deity" category.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.340
Wait, you categorize them by realms?

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:47.660
Of course.

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.820
I had way too many idols growing up.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.340
I had to categorize them
just to keep the rankings straight.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.520
I used to list my idols on the wall,

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.720
ranking them

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.400
by brains and brawn.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.000
I had no idea you were

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.460
such a little troublemaker back then.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:00.740
I bet you were a real headache
for your parents.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:04.780
It wasn't that bad.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:06.320
What about you?

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.000
Me?

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.760
I was a golden child.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:10.400
I just had my moments

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:11.380
of being a little rascal.

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:14.600
Let's hear more about these "moments."

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:18.860
I rolled around in the mud

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.120
and I once defeated a giant goose
with a stick.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:22.920
Wait,

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.820
did we miss

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:26.840
a Shenjing Goose shop?

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:30.220
Seems like it.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:34.840
It's still early.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:35.680
Let's head over there now.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.260
It's 10 PM.
You think that's still early?

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.760
Hey, this is Guangzhou, not Jiangsu.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:42.780

Since you're sleeping in until noon,

maybe I'll use the morning

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.260
to set up a little surprise.

So the plan is just to keep me eating

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:48.800
Shake it off.

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.480
Who could've guessed a giant like that

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:51.200
would sink so low

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:52.100
as to forge guarantee documents?

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:53.200
It's an extreme case.

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.000
Exactly. Stop beating yourself up.

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.280
Even the old pros

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:57.100
got blindsided by this.

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.520
Besides,
Mr. Song isn't pinning this on us.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.420
Stop making excuses for me.

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:04.140
I own my actions.

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:05.520
I messed up, and I'm not hiding from it.

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:06.500
Zhuang,

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:07.600
do you feel

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:08.620
that this industry

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.020
no longer offers broad-based growth,

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.300
but only structural opportunities?

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:18.420
I've noticed

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:19.460
the top-tier firms

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.200
have indeed started

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.040
preparing for early exits.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:27.800
Zhuang Xu.

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:36.620
I'm here to apologize.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:39.580
I was indeed reckless

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:40.900
regarding that Rimang Energy project.

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.320
I've read the research report

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:49.000
you led.

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:50.360
Your positive take

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:51.500
wasn't off base.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:52.560
Besides,

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:53.840
I'm your colleague.

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:55.020
We're

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:56.060
on the same team here at Huaya.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:57.660
You don't need to apologize to me.

00:26:58.620 --> 00:26:59.640
The main thing is,

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:00.980
I make mistakes too.

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:02.440
Aside from the boss,

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:05.060
I don't want

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:06.040
to have to apologize to everyone here

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:11.260
If you don't need my apology,

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:13.460
let me thank you instead.

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:14.740
Thank you

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:17.120
for sparing me
from endless self-reflection meetings.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.360
I don't think that's necessary either,

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:20.600
but alright.

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:21.920
I accept that.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:23.940
In that case,

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:25.180
if you guys are free after work,

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.100
dinner is on me.

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.020
Let's celebrate

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:29.920
our narrow escape.

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:31.540
Great.

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:32.920
Kevin and Justin
are definitely wide open.

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:34.260
Zhuang, don't work late tonight.

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:35.420
Let's grab a drink and a bite,

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.320
and just catch up.

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:38.300
Free drinks?

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:40.860
Of course, I'm in.

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:43.300
Come to think of it,

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.480
I believe this is the first time

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:45.760
our little squad has grabbed dinner
off the clock.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:47.120
Come on.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:50.040
Let's raise a glass
to our very first team bonding.

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:51.180
Cheers!

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:52.280
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:27:58.960 --> 00:27:59.560
Alright, next,

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:01.680
let's all raise a glass to Zhuang.

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:03.260
Seriously, Zhuang,

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:04.380
if it weren't for you,

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:05.560
our year-end bonuses

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:06.600
would've been history.

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:08.040
Bonuses? Please.

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:09.220
The whole department

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:10.920
would've been axed and reshuffled.

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:12.840
We definitely owe Zhuang a drink.

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:14.560
You guys are laying it on a bit thick.

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.940
Besides, Mr. Song was the one

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:17.720
who made the final call.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:19.520
Yeah, but he's not around right now.

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:20.460
Exactly.

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:21.740
We're off the clock.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:22.600
No boss talk.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:24.480
Whatever the case,

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:26.160
thank you, Zhuang.

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:27.060
Come on.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:33.080
Seriously,

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:34.600
a restructure is out of the question.

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:36.420
I mean, we've got the hottest girl

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:37.720
and the most eligible guy

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:38.440
in the entire Shanghai finance scene

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.520
right here in this group.

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.580
Well, the "most eligible guy"

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:42.600
is obviously me.

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.380
But wait.

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.100
Who's the "hottest girl" then?

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:48.780
Kevin,

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.060
explain yourself.

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:01.680
Forget it.

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:03.380
I'll just take a shot,

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:04.580
okay?

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:05.880
Oh, give me a break.

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:07.080
You're just looking for any excuse
to knock one back.

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:07.780
Seriously, Kevin,

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:09.180
are you moonlighting

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.360
as a liquor promoter here?

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:11.260
Sure looks like it.

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:13.660
You on a quota tonight?

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:18.240
I think I had you all wrong.

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:19.800
I never knew you were so funny.

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:21.660
I feel like

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:22.980
we only truly got to

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:23.740
know each other today.

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:24.360
Is that so?

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:28.020
Glad to meet you, Chris.

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.280
Justin just crowned himself
the most eligible.

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.500
He's gotta have a drink, right?

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:41.060
Exactly.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.300
What a narcissist.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:43.200
Make it two shots.

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:45.220
Fine.

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:53.340
Hello?

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:55.480
Not yet.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.580
Probably around 10 PM.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:29:59.340
You go to bed first.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:02.600
Oh my goodness.

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:03.840
This is huge.

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:04.940
Is Huaya's number one heartthrob

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:05.780
off the market?

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:06.420
Yeah.

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:07.420
So gentle

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:08.620
and checking in like that.

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:10.760
What nonsense?

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:11.720
It was my brother.

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:13.440
He's visiting from Nanjing

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:14.600
for his winter vacation.

Poetry?

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.300
Does Xu actually read this stuff?

00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:57.820
Xu,

00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:58.660
you're back.

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:08.780
You reek of alcohol.

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:10.500
How much did you drink?

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:12.420
I'm not drunk.

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:15.560
You should really cut back
on the drinking.

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:18.560
There's no getting out of these things.

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:23.700
I'll go get you some warm water.

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:36.440
Good thing I'm here.

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:38.220
Otherwise,

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:39.320
if you got this drunk,

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:41.020
would you have just spent the night
on the couch?

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:48.920
Have some water.

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:50.800
Then go freshen up and get some sleep.

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:56.280
Zhuang Fei.

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:01.800
Tell me.

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:05.800
Back then,

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:09.120
if she had come to Shanghai with me,

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:13.660
would she have worried

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:16.320
about me drinking too much

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:17.500
and staying out too late?

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:20.840
Would she have urged me
to come home earlier?

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:28.700
Would she have called me like you did,

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:35.160
asking what I'm up to,

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:40.460
and when I'll be back?

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:43.340
What are you talking about?

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.120
Isn't Rong already here in Shanghai?

Boss,

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.520
here are two sets of documents
for you to review.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.120
You finished

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:13.420
two completely different plans already?

00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:15.040
They're just

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.560
rough drafts.

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:18.040
I need you

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.480
to confirm the overall direction.

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:21.060
But all the departments

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:22.639
were really fast and helpful.

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:24.940
I should really give you
the credit for that.

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:27.080
How so?

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:28.600

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.060
The night I got back here,

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:32.199
I invited some girls from the office

00:34:32.199 --> 00:34:33.820
who live on-site

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:34.639
to share them.

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:36.460
After that,

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:37.620
they've been super helpful
with everything.

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.199
They're all so capable.

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:40.320

a lot from them.

00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:59.940
It's a new building concept.

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:01.900
I find it really interesting.

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.400
Plus, Engineering

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:04.160
confirmed it's feasible

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:05.520
for implementation.

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:07.840
We did

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:08.660
look into

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:09.280
BIPV before.

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:10.240
Shuangyuan

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:11.720
has a huge edge,

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:12.840
being backed by developers

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:14.320
like Shengyuan and Yuancheng.

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:15.480
But it was

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.140
sidelined recently

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:18.120
due to overseas sanctions.

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:21.580
What's your take

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:22.720
on the future

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:23.380
of BIPV?

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:25.960
I believe

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:27.280
it will see

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.800
widespread adoption

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.320
in public and commercial buildings.

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:31.720
Since the government is promoting

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:32.900
energy conservation
and emission reduction,

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.400
it's clearly the inevitable trend.

00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:35.820
Then why the hesitation?

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.440
I'm hesitating over the budget.

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:39.360
Even though BIPV

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:40.900
is technically challenging,

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.920
Mr. Hua is already itching

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.040
to get started and says

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:44.800
he has a solution ready.

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:46.400
But the budget

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.600
still makes me hesitant.

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.920
After all, the industry
is in a downturn.

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:51.880
Is it really necessary

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:53.280
to build a garden like this

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:55.160
and eat into our cash flow,

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:56.820
especially right now?

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.240
Good points.

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:03.400
But honestly,
the frontline working conditions

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:04.820
are long overdue for an improvement.

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:06.780
Plus, with integrated tech,

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.280
this garden

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:09.660
becomes

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:10.700
a vital demo site.

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:13.300
It'll give clients a hands-on feel

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.540
for what we do.

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:16.340
That should help us

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:17.260
land more contracts.

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:18.580
Right.

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:20.840
It would act as a flagship project.

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:24.500
Anyway,

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:25.580
just go for it.

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:27.920
The budget

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:29.420
for a small garden

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:30.520
is well within my reach.

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.260
Mr. Lin,

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:37.900
this is you at your best.

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.100
You should've had

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:43.120
your eyes checked years ago.

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:47.380
Mr. Lin,

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:48.680
Mr. Ding from Engineering

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:49.520
and Mr. Wu from Finance

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:50.160
are here for the meeting.

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:54.900
Go ahead.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.540
Let's finish this once you're free.

00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:58.060
Actually, why don't you sit in?

00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.240
It covers construction details.

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:01.540
Could be useful for your project.

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:03.900
Okay.

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:06.200
Phase II of the plant

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:07.920
is a resumption of construction
after a long halt.

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:09.680
With the gap in between,

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:11.140
some staff turnover

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:11.660
and coordination gaps

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:12.880
were bound to happen.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.420
But these are small hiccups.

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.560
Engineering stepped in

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:17.900
and cleared

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:19.460
most of the hurdles already.

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:20.800
Barring any surprises,

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:22.220
the work should wrap up by late March.

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:23.740
We'll need Administration's support

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:25.300
for the final inspections.

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.260
We'll make sure everything is ready.

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.560
Also, the contractor

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:30.680
mentioned

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:31.540
that the third installment

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:32.720
is due

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:33.580
next Monday.

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:34.600
We'll need

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:35.400
Finance to coordinate

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:36.760
and ensure the remittance
is made on time.

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:38.000
No problem.

00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:39.860
As long as they issue
the invoices on time,

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:40.900
we're ready to process the payment.

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:43.440
However,

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:44.360
Mr. Lin,

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:45.320
we're still

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:46.440
facing that same old issue.

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:47.920
The shareholders' funding

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:48.820
for the Phase II plant construction

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:50.480
has yet to be fully paid up.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.640
Thanks to your coordination,

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:54.160
we managed to secure alternative funding

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:55.340
to cover the gap.

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:57.700
But Shuangyuan is a joint venture.

00:37:58.040 --> 00:37:59.240
The Phase II project

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.640
was a proposal

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:01.960
passed unanimously by the board.

00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:02.800
With construction

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:03.820
at this stage,

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.240
it's unacceptable

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.420
that Yuancheng's investment

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:07.880
still hasn't hit our account.

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:13.400
What's the word from Yuancheng?

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:15.060
We've been in frequent communication

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:16.300
with their finance and legal teams.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.320
They're responsive enough
in their replies,

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:19.340
but there's been

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.420
no actual follow-through.

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:21.780
If the funds aren't in place

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:22.560
by next month,

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:23.740
Legal may have to

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:24.740
join Shengyuan in issuing

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.360
a formal notice to Yuancheng.

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:43.860
[Jiang Rui]

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:51.500
Hello?

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:53.340
Dearest Xiguang,

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:54.460
I have some great news.

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:56.940
Guess who's finally on holiday? Me!

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:00.800
Yeah,

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.780
I can feel your joy.

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:05.260
But keep it classy.

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:05.960
Don't flex

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.700
on someone that's still working.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.000
Oh, stop playing the pity card.

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:11.940
How about I swing by Suzhou to see you?

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:13.000
Don't.

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:14.360
I'm swamped.

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:15.700
I've got the year-end party coming up,

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:16.580
so don't come here and mess with me.

00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:19.400
We're spending
Chinese New Year's Eve

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:20.440
at my place this year

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:21.660
and then flying to Baishan City.

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.120
We'll see each other
in just a few days anyway.

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:25.120
I was just saying.

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.040
It's not like
I'm actually going to Suzhou.

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:28.300
Right, speaking of Changbai Mountain,

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:29.620
the parents had already agreed

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:30.460
to go skiing abroad,

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:31.440
so why did you suddenly change it

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:32.120
to Changbai Mountain?

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.140
What's wrong with Changbai Mountain?

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:36.060
Don't just assume
everything abroad is better.

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:38.220
It's the largest natural ski resort

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:39.740
in Asia,

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:41.640
and the food there is amazing.

00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:42.940
You'd never find
anything tasty overseas.

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:44.640
Why are you being so cranky?

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:49.480
Are you in a bad mood or something?

00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:51.560
You can actually tell?

00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:52.840
Of course I can.

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:54.380
It's not

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:55.620
that Deputy GM from the Sheng family

00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:56.460
giving you a hard time again, is it?

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:00.920
No,

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:02.420
it's not him.

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:05.760
He was actually comforting me.

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:08.360
About what?

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:15.740
My company

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:17.700
is expanding the Phase II plant, right?

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:20.140
Well, I only found out today
after a meeting

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:21.800
with Engineering and Finance,

00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:23.680
that my dad has been behind

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:25.260
on the expansion payments
this whole time.

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:27.060
If he doesn't pay up soon,

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.340
the company is going to issue
a formal notice.

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:29.680
Wait, really?

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:31.060
Yeah.

00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:32.720
When I found out,

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:33.860
I was

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:34.820
so mortified.

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.500
Maybe your dad is having

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:41.600
some liquidity issues.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:42.460
But still,

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:43.520
it's a corporate matter.

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:44.400
Why take it so personally?

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:45.580
Business is business.

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:46.800
At worst, he can just offset
the debt with equity.

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:48.280
No unpaid wages,

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.020
no need to feel awkward.

00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:53.260
Fine.

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:55.780
You do have a point.

00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:57.960
That's what Lin Yusen said, too.

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:01.600
Sounds like you and Mr. Lin

00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:03.440
are getting closer and closer.

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:11.280
For sure.

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:12.860
Over time,

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:14.240
my kindness and charm

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:15.720
are finally working on him.

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:16.920
Alright, I'm hanging up.

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:17.800
I can't take this anymore, Xiguang.

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:19.900
I'll hang up first.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:22.440
Bye.

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:23.940
See you on Chinese New Year's Eve.

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:24.800
Bye.

[Group for Class 5, Grade 12]
Everyone cool with that?

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:34.740
Then the 5th day
of Chinese New Year it is.

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.160
Wait,

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:37.180
what'd I miss?

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.460
Everyone's back in Nanjing
for the break anyway,

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:40.940
so we're hitting up a class reunion.

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.560
I can't make the 5th.

00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:44.920
Why?

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:48.140
I'm hitting Changbai Mountain
on the Spring Festival.

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:48.760
By the 5th,

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:49.960
I'll still be shredding the slopes.

00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:51.680
Why not before Chinese New Year?

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:53.620
Some are still interning,

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:54.780
and some haven't made it back yet.

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:56.400
We won't have a full house
until after the festival.

00:41:59.220 --> 00:41:59.760
Bummer.

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:01.160
Guess I'm missing out.

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:02.060
Changbai Mountain?

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:03.140
I was there two years ago.

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:04.300

No way.

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:08.620
That's exactly

We've got a whole villa to ourselves.

Remember

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:16.740
when I was limping around

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:17.620
for quite a while?

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:18.520
Yeah,

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:19.960
so that was from skiing.

00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:22.420
