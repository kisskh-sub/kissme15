(Hong Zhua, God of War
of the Immortal Realm)

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.420
(Jin Li, Demon subduing Immortal)

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.840
Greeting, Hong Zhua.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.400
Sorry for being late.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.150
Jin Li,

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.000
you've been lurking
in the Demon Realm for years.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.010
Have you found a way
to vanquish the Demon Clan?

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.200
This is the Demon Defense Array
of the Demon Realm.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.070
Good.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:28.950
With the Array,

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.840
we can wipe out the Demon Clan.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.280
Jin Li,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.760
the time has come.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.310
You'll have

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.560
to execute Jie Chuan,

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.640
Demon Sovereign.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.880
Jin Li,

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.710
why did you deceive me?

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.420
(Jie Chuan, Demon Sovereign)

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.910
Jin Li,

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.680
you betrayed me.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.760
Is everything we shared

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.560
in the past all a lie?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.840
Jin Li,

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.220
the immortal and demon realms
can never coexist.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.680
Do it.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.400
Jin Li,

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.470
do not forget your mission.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.080
I'm sorry.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.630
Sorry?

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.950
Even if it costs you body and soul,

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.600
you still intend to kill me?

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.070
My love for you is sincere.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.270
But killing you

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.950
is my fate.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.240
I have to betray you.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.480
May we never meet again.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:04.600
Jin LI!

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:35.750
(I'm willing)

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.430
(to trade all our memories)

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.920
(for one trace of your soul to remain.)

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.160
(From this moment on,)

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:44.590
(I shall be sealed forever)

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.070
(in the Void Land
beyond the Three Realms.)

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.270
(We shall never meet again)

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.920
(All that has happened)

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.190
(shall end here today.)

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.430
(Everything's over.)

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.160
All has been shaped
by fate and fortune.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.800
Since Jin Li has chosen you,

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.680
you shall nurture Jin Li's soul.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:27.310
From this day forth,

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.920
you are my disciple.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.870
I shall call you

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.830
Ji Li.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.420
(300 years later)

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.420
(Ji Li, Immortal Beast)

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.510
(Jie Chuan and Jin Li)

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.800
(used their flesh and blood
to form this Hybrid Tree.)

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.120
(It blooms and bears fruit
only once every three centuries.)

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.510
(The Spirit Fruit can grant
a thousand years of cultivation,)

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.720
(bestowing an eternal form.)

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.600
Spirit Fruit,

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.240
my master spent most
of his cultivation

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.800
to turn me from a fish into human.

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:04.000
Today, you shall fall.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.510
I'm going to take you back

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:06.950
to celebrate my master's birthday.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:53.700
(Void Land)

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.630
It chills to the touch.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.540
This is the Frost Blossom.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.240
They say

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.270
it only appears in the Void Land.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:46.630
This is the Void Land.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.960
The Void Land

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:57.550
has been hidden away for years.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.120
Now,

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.150
even a weak immortal

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.670
can freely come here?

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:09.870
Who are you?

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.510
You don't deserve to know.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.360
What is your name?

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.000
Are you from the Speech Clan?

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.670
My master once told me

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.440
the Speech Clan can seize souls

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.000
by knowing one's name.

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:24.910
Speech Clan?

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.270
They're timid in nature

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.080
and poor in their arts.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.480
In the great war 300 years ago,

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.200
countless immortals perished

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.250
to subdue the Demon Clan,

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:40.390
which left their spirits

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:41.510
drifting outside,

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:43.480
unable to be found.

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:45.960
Are you one of them?

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.200
Noisy.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.630
Such a massive ice spike

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:54.320
is stuck here for three centuries.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.440
Doesn't it hurt?

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.460
(Hall of the Demon Realm)

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.540
(Sunlight Hall of the Immortal Realm)

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:31.990
This is bad.

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.120
I can sense it.

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:44.870
That power is Demonic Ether.

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:46.480
(Luo Cha)

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.630
It must be my brother.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.200
Heed my command.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:51.390
Soon,

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.630
we shall welcome Jie Chuan
back to his throne.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:54.960
Yes.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.360
Who exactly are you?

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.110
With such meager spiritual power,

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.930
why were you able
to awaken the ice spike?

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.600
For 300 years,

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.320
I've tried every possible way,

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:14.790
yet none have succeeded.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.110
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:18.720
It's fine.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.750
Can you pull the ice spike out

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.240
and free me from this?

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:23.910
Free you?

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.870
Are you an immortal or a demon?

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.550
Do you need to rank

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:29.000
the worth of saving someone?

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.000
If I'm not an immortal,

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.550
would you refuse to help?

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.750
I don't divide lives into ranks.

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:35.910
Nor do I judge by clan.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:37.200
But I at least need to know.

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.720
What if you turn out

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.560
to be a cruel demon?

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.720
(If she learns my true identity,)

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:44.800
(I fear...)

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.040
Immortal Beast,

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:48.790
you're smart.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:50.390
I was once

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:52.870
an immortal in the great war.

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:54.390
I was gravely wounded

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:56.650
and trapped here for many years,

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.390
endured endless torment.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:00.600
You are

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.390
an immortal?

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.440
Why do you carry
no trace of immortal aura?

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:07.750
You are

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:08.840
quite cautious.

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:12.120
I was sealed

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.120
by the ice spike here.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.840
Now,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.360
I only have

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:19.720
a bit spiritual power in my palm,

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.080
not enough to break the seal.

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:27.360
You truly are an immortal.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:29.630
Alright.

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:30.470
I'll save you.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.080
Don't pull it out.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.790
Master, I'm saving an immortal.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:03.060
Seal that ice spike back.

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:04.090
Master, look.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:05.550
He's not an immortal.

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:08.800
He's Jie Chuan, Demon Sovereign.

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:54.320
Hong Zhua.

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:57.510
