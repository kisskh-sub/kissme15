Suzu is my only childhood friend.

One day, Suzu started aspiring to be an actress.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:38.390
So, we started role-playing like kids.

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:43.620
Suzu would be the actress, and I'd be her manager.

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:48.230
There also happened to be an important audition.

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:50.990
She said she wanted honest feedback.

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:54.260
An objective opinion is important.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.250
I guess that's true.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:03.680
I should've spoken about her strengths,
but I just listed her weaknesses.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.600
I did that even when she didn't make the cut
for a role she really wanted.

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:11.920
I didn't spare a thought for her feelings.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:17.600
Suzu was always so kind and did her best.

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:22.880
I trampled on all of that.

If I fell sick eating spicy chicken,

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:30.320
I'd quit eating it for life. You got hurt playing a manager.

If it were me, I wouldn't do it again.

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:36.420
Why did you come to the Manager course?

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:41.660
Suzu will definitely become a fabulous actress.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.370
Without a doubt.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.270
And you'll be her manager?

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.920
Will your friend even agree?

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.130
- Freaking hell.
- What?

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.300
Did I say something wrong?

and how you're risking everything to get the scholarship
out of worry for your mom,

You're going to spill the beans, too?

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:26.260
That I sacrificed a friend for my scholarship?

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.710
Fine, go ahead.

Just break up with me now.

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:41.890
When everyone said you were conceited,
selfish, and annoying,

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:47.700
I found you capable, strong, and pretty.

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:51.620
They're right.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:56.710
Once I start hating you completely, we'll break up.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:47.040
Yes, together!

What is this?

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:57.750
How's that possible?

00:15:57.750 --> 00:15:59.890
- I'll look for it and come back.
- Really?

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:02.710
This Korean product also looks good.

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:03.950
It really spreads out.

Wow, it's something.

I was really shocked!

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:14.210
Lower the difficulty and leap straight for it.

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:15.580
You can eat and drink it.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.250
That's true.

Look at that!

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:40.500
- I see something.
- Oh, you're right!

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.460
Idiot, we need to reset your phone.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.700
Give it to me.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:15.430
What should I do? Maybe his heart needs a reset.

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.670
Screw off.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.470
Try sky diving or bungee jumping instead.

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:38.150
If I fall now, who'll hurt more? You or me?

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:40.550
Tighten your vocal cords.

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:42.990
Yawn and lower your larynx.

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:55.990
Okay.

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:08.420
[Suzu's Setting]

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:10.040
[Before Suzu decides to commit suicide]

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.570
Suzu will definitely become an actor.

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:15.980
An amazing one.

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.400
When Suzu wakes up,

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:22.160
and if she gives me a chance,

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:27.010
I will become someone she'll need.

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:32.550
Gu Eun Ho pretends he doesn't notice,
but he's already a step ahead.

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:34.580
Cut! Okay!

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:38.340
I still have another interpretation.

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:39.980
Sure.

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:45.030
Hang on.

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:52.490
Let's redo everything.

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:53.810
Huh?

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:55.530
Gu Eun Ho.

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:59.300
Do the lines with me this time.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.230
You can't tell anyone.

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:20.110
I have no other friends, except you.

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:24.190
Will someone as ordinary as me become an actor?

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:28.170
Of course, you have a great voice and wonderful skin.

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:31.040
Well, will you be my manager?

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.830
Your manager?

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:35.680
Do I have what it takes?

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:39.050
When I waver, you'll be there to hold me.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:44.240
Sure! I'll become a manager for you, Suzu!

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:50.840
Don't I have strengths?
Why do you only talk about my flaws?

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.330
Who are you to tear me down?

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:54.970
So, you're trying to run away.

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:56.720
No.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:01.200
You don't want to act.
It's just the delusion of fame you're after.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.220
That's not it!

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:06.290
I was clueless and so earnest.

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.130
What are you doing there?

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:18.180
Suzu, come down.

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:24.440
Do you know when I'm with you, I feel like dying?

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:29.930
N-No.

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:32.390
Suzu!

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:44.980
Suzu will definitely become an actor. An amazing one.

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:50.410
And I'll become his manager.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:52.640
No doubt about that.

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:21.970
Let's break up for real.

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:26.560
I loved you, Shin Ji Ah.

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:34.400
The rooftop is really the most refreshing!

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.220
It's been so long.

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:38.050
- Of course, you have a great voice.
- What are you watching?

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:43.010
- Hey, Hana's group uploaded a video.
- and wonderful skin.

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:44.690
A manager?

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:47.550
Do I have what it takes?

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:50.940
Damn it.

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:55.540
Sure! I'll become a manager for you, Suzu.

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.110
What will you do now?

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:59.780
The four kings really nailed it this time.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.830
My head hurts like hell!

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:07.140
Hana-chan's one thing, but what about Shin Ji Ah?

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:11.860
You picked the wrong girl.
Maybe you'll end up transferring schools this time.

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:17.190
Say that again.

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:25.470
I-I mean...

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:30.330
Actually, she hacked your group's account.

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:33.910
She uploaded the article.

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.540
Damn you.

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.470
Ugh, what do I do now?

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:53.720
Suzu will definitely become an actor. An amazing one.

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:25.110
I like that you're conceited, selfish, and annoying.

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:07.620
What are they doing?

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:09.630
Holy hell.

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:23.360
I'm sorry.

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:26.630
It seemed like it'd be the last.

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:30.440
You said you didn't post it.

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:36.490
You're better off dumping a guy like me.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.470
What are you doing?

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:47.630
Why would I dump a kind boyfriend
who understands me better than I do...

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:58.720
Does that mean... you aren't dumping me?

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:06.700
I won't.

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:10.030
You mean it?

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:12.270
I mean it.

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:29.720
But I feel so sorry to Hana-chan.

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:38.080
Let's go.

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:05.560
Hey, look.

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:09.120
Good morning.

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.960
Good morning, Hana-chan.

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.850
Morning, Hana-chan.

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:22.530

I mean, right beside you.

Oh, it's mine.

So good! I really want to get some!

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:03.920
It's a blessing to smell this.

Okay.

I have no other friends, except you.

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:44.990
But an ordinary girl like me
dreaming of being an actress is ridiculous.

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:49.900
Why's that? Your voice is great, and your complexion is amazing.

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:55.150
But I have to go on a diet, huh.

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:59.620
I guess even the skinny folks diet.

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:07.980
Why is there so much delicious food in the world?

When I waver or hesitate, you'll have to support me.

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:32.030
Sure.

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:34.260
It's a promise, okay?

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:36.870
Yeah.

Didn't we see this back then?

You said they were cute.

Polka dotted clothes are good.

Really? You have to start today then.

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:09.300
Today, I should take note of the color black.

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:11.440

- Really?
- It's eyelashes are also curled.

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:33.760
Even its cheeks have blusher.

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:36.630
This really looks like you.

There are so many, but this one is the cutest.
