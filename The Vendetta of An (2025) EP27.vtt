[The Vendetta of An]

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.060
She can survive seven days

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.750
without food and water.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.520
She's not an ordinary girl.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.860
This woman is a shadow guard sent from Chang'an.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.620
Before we discovered her identity,

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.510
she lied

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.990
and said she came to Tiemo as a merchant.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.740
She has lived here alone for seven months.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.970
A lot of information was sent back to Chang'an

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.690
through her.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.370
These shadow guards have

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.740
a common name in Chang'an.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.580
They are called the Huben Army.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.810
Huben Army?

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.770
Yes.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.860
There's a person called Liu Ziwen in Chang'an

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.150
who put them through systemic training

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.370
and sent these people

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.530
to Tiemo in secret.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.060
Liu Ziwen

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.490
was just an administrative official.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:09.650
Do you want to go to Chang'an?

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.020
Of course.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.460
There's tea in Chang'an.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.300
The information

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.300
obtained from this woman

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.860
has helped turn the tide of war.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.460
I heard

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.530
the people on Mount Shiluoman's altar

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.090
wanted you to go further north.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.090
Do you not want

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.970
this opportunity any more?

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.860
Does it matter if I want it or not?

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.970
Even if I become the king of Tiemo,

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.620
I can only live with everyone else

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.520
on this barren

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.810
and freezing land.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.580
If we want to end Tiemo's suffering,

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.740
we must head south

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.340
and go to Chang'an.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.460
I have an idea.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.140
We can also do the same as Liu Ziwen.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.180
We'll train a group of shadow guards

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.860
and send them to Chang'an.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.580
We'll let them blend into every corner

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.770
of Chang'an.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.130
It might take five years

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.780
or 30 years.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.490
When Chang'an is at its weakest,

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.420
it'll be time when we, the Tiemo people,

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.010
come out of our suffering.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.180
Not us.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.540
Just you.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.330
What?

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.490
Cen Pickles.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.060
You're not going to Chang'an with me?

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.250
We shouldn't go together.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.620
We shouldn't do the same thing.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.690
Even if we meet

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.490
in Chang'an one day,

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.980
even if we are beside Liu Ziwen,

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.250
we shouldn't reunite with each other.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:55.060
I think

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.130
doing that as a shadow guard

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:58.660
is the only way to deceive

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.810
Liu Ziwen, who is good at using shadow guards.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.180
Only by deceiving Liu Ziwen,

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.930
can we deceive all our enemies.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:07.450
That is

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.420
how we can achieve something great.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.540
Yes. You are right.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:13.960
You've gotten smarter.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.940
Cen Pickles, you've become smarter.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.660
Let me say one more thing.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:21.630
You must not die

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:22.490
before we achieve a great cause.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:23.060
All right?

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.370
If I die, I'm afraid

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.570
no one will help collect your dead body.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.450
This is a good enough reason

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.570
for me to stay alive.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.660
Sure.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.860
We must both be alive.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.250
See you in Chang'an.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.340
[Episode 27]

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.620
Open his mouth

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.330
and see if he is hiding a small metal piece inside.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.660
Yes.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:09.490
Open!

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.690
Sir, there's nothing.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.480
Do you find it fun

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.330
to humiliate me?

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.010
I'm not humiliating you.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:36.330
Don't you know?

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.810
Xie Huai'an

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.740
will come and rescue you later.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.620
Both of you have a strong bond.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.540
He is afraid that you'd rather suicide

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.490
than let him risk his life to save you.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.660
You can't die yet.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:54.860
Is that not true?

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:00.650
- Move. - Move.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.620
About the wonton stall...

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.450
I went there last night.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:18.930
No one was there

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.330
and there were no traces of an ambush.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:23.890
Right.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.330
Xie Huai'an won't set up an ambush

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.010
at a place that has been exposed.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:30.780
What will

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.180
he try to do this time?

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.490
Mister.

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:00.860
The street is empty.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.100
No one is coming

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.330
to buy wine today.

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:08.220
Whether someone comes here or not

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.450
isn't important.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.570
What's important for me

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.890
is sitting here.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:19.860
A war is starting.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:21.130
Mister,

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.860
why aren't you leaving?

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.890
I'm already seated here.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.890
Where else can I go?

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.810
But if we lose

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:38.300
and Chang'an falls,

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:40.900
you will

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.540
also die.

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.420
The fall

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.180
of a city

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.210
and deaths are inevitable.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.810
But Heaven

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.610
and Earth

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:58.060
won't change, right?

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.210
You're right.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.660
Heaven and Earth won't change.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.570
Then, I'll sit here.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:26.900
All I have

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.540
is cheap wine.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.610
I'm not buying wine today.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.660
I'm only buying a bench.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:33.900
A bench...

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:35.210
Please accept it.

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:48.990
Xie Huai'an.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:49.930
Xie Huai'an!

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:51.810
Don't be foolish!

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:53.140
Xie Huai'an.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:54.610
Run!

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:56.090
Run!

00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:58.610
What are you doing?

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.490
Why did you come here alone?

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:01.040
Xie Huai'an,

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.900
are you listening?

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:04.690
Xie Huai'an!

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:11.930
Xie Huai'an.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.090
What trick are you trying to pull?

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:15.690
Where are your strategies

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.140
and ambushes?

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.260
I'm the only one here.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:25.210
Don't worry.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.540
The King of Tiemo wants to get rid of me.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.420
I'm at my wits' end.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.180
Instead of resisting,

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.540
I chose to bid farewell

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.690
to my friend

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.140
before I die.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:50.730
When this is over,

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:52.690
I

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.610
leave myself at Tiemo's mercy.

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:03.450
This place is secure.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:06.450
Even if I meet my pageboy here,

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:09.330
we won't be able to escape.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:14.020
It's a small wish from someone who is about to die.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.540
I hope you'll allow it.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.200
You resisted us alone for so long

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:26.300
and finally surrendered.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.850
I will fulfill the wish

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.450
of a dying person.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:32.730
Let him out.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.060
You've suffered.

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:36.930
Why?

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.300
Why didn't you listen to me?

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:48.780
Why did you come?

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.500
I know

00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:59.060
I can't save you at this moment.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.660
But I have something to tell you

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:05.930
so I wait for you here.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.360
But if you do this, you'll...

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.570
I have to

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.930
meet the King of Tiemo sooner or later.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.810
This is my destiny.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.140
Xie Huai'an,

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.020
are you trying to give your life away?

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.730
What will I do if you die?

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.730
What about Ye Zheng?

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:37.970
What about Xiaoqing?

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.300
Even if you don't care about us,

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:45.810
what about Bai Wan?

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:50.840
When she was alive,

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:51.910
she wanted you

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:53.420
to stay alive.

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.730
People die and return to the soil.

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.420
We can't go to another world.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:14.970
It's also impossible

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:18.380
to meet our family members who died.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:21.850
Staying alive

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:25.570
is the only way to remember them.

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:30.540
I came here today

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:35.260
to bid farewell to you.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:39.720
But if you do this,

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.780
you will really die.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:47.970
Don't worry.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.180
I guarantee

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.300
we'll surely meet again.

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:57.500
However, this is important.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.680
I believe

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.330
you will surely

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:06.140
get this done.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:12.900
Go.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:38.220
[Qingyun Pavilion]

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:45.780
I used to say

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:48.180
that I'm the only one who can keep you alive.

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:51.380
I gave you Mo's face

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.990
and make you a pageboy to protect you.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.300
You might not have what it takes to be an emperor,

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:01.300
but you know the suffering of the people.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.930
After the war is over,

00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:06.570
if you are willing to leave your past behind

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:08.330
and stay in the imperial court,

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.020
it will be a blessing to the world.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.780
If that day does come,

00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:20.220
will you still be by my side?

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:26.100
I will.

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:28.110
When that day arrives,

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:30.840
I will be your pageboy.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.650
You look calm.

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.020
You don't look like you're here to die.

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:21.260
Where I die

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:22.700
isn't important.

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:24.810
I only know

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:26.850
that the person who shares my goal

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.570
is already in front of the King of Tiemo.

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:35.810
Free him.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:50.260
This way, please.

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:32.130
He's here.

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:33.810
I'm cooking the lamb.

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.610
It seems like I came at the right time.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.810
However, there's not enough firewood.

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:57.130
Let me do it.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.780
How long has it been since this stove was last used?

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.740
The stove is too wet.

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:41.940
I don't know.

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:45.090
It might be an unusable stove.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.890
Young man, you are still too inexperienced.

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:10.890
The stove is too wet.

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:18.460
Books burn quicker.

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:24.330
I want to burn books, too.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.130
Are you willing to...

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:27.980
I would never do it back then.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.460
Now, both of you

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:31.330
are here.

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:35.060
Burn it.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:48.650
What a good book.

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:51.500
I'm burning it.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.330
White Hair.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.500
You want me dead so badly.

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:17.850
If I'm dead,

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:20.800
do you still have somewhere to go?

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.650
I hid in Huainan

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.460
for seven years.

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:31.570
I had a job

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.260
at a remote place.

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:36.370
It was relaxing.

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:40.550
I used to help the people

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.020
go down the field,

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:43.610
plant paddy,

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:45.740
and harvest the grains.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.370
Now that I think about it,

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.780
I actually miss the place.

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:54.810
It certainly sounds like a prosperous place.

00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:58.090
No.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.130
Huainan isn't a prosperous place.

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:03.410
If it suffers from a natural disaster,

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.500
people will still starve to death.

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:09.300
There were despicable magistrates

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.330
who wouldn't spare food from the official granary.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.060
I broke open granaries once

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:17.460
and was imprisoned.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.090
And if I die,

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.090
do you have somewhere to go?

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.090
I don't.

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:45.260
I can no longer return

00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:48.780
to where I've been before.

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:55.570
I

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:57.220
was a slave when I was young.

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:00.650
My father also grew up as a slave.

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:03.740
In the noble families of Tiemo,

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:05.060
slaves

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.440
use themselves as bait

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.850
to lure out the wolves and kill them.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:12.300
Then,

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:15.020
the sheep in the pen can survive.

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.940
Because of that,

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:21.020
they don't care no matter how many slaves they sacrifice.

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:23.460
In the end,

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:26.460
I retrieved my father's limbs

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:29.330
in the mouth of a wolf.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.610
I still remember

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:38.610
the feeling of hunger back then.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.610
But even if

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:46.090
your father is dead,

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.060
your master still won't

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:50.780
give you a full meal.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.020
Later,

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.300
more slaves followed me.

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:58.700
I only wanted to capture a town

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:01.020
but the feeling of hunger

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.330
still followed me.

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:04.370
Later,

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:06.540
after that,

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:10.850
I want to dominate the world.

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:21.650
Today is a farewell.

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:24.260
One will only

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.610
say some sincere words during a farewell.

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:32.810
Speaking of which,

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:35.500
how White Hair

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:36.500
broke open a granary in Huainan

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.260
resembled what we did when we were young.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:40.500
Yes.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:45.410
10 years ago?

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.260
20 years ago?

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:48.170
No.

00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:50.410
It was 40 years ago.

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:19.090
There are so many sheep

00:28:19.091 --> 00:28:39.285
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:21.410
but they still force us to kill and eat wolves.

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:22.620
Wolf meat is sour.

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:23.840
Since we will die one way or another,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.020
let's have a feast for now.

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:28.850
Must we die?

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:32.020
Do you have a way?

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.650
Those who kill for the nobles

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.940
are also slaves.

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:39.060
If they come after us,

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:40.300
I will tell them

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:41.500
what we did.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:43.740
I'm going to ask them

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.020
why nobles can kill slaves without any punishment

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.020
but when a slave kills a noble,

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.610
they will be punished.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:51.370
I also want to ask them

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.500
why can't we be the nobles

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:54.230
and let them be the slaves.

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:55.080
- Yes! - Yes!

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:56.020
Exactly.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.790
We can also become nobles.

00:28:58.030 --> 00:28:58.650
Exactly.

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:02.170
We can become someone who kills sheep without feeling sorry.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.410
We can kill another person without being punished.

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:12.540
Are you scared?

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:14.220
No.

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:17.020
It has nothing to do with what you said.

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:19.460
I didn't expect

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.220
the meat to be so fatty.

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:23.370
I wish I had some pickles

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:24.980
to cut out the greasiness.

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.010
Look at you.

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:28.700
- You're such a good-for-nothing. - Do you hear yourself?

00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:30.370
You sound so lame.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.300
After both of us came to Chang'an,

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.260
we had not reunited with each other for more than two decades.

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.500
Just in case we encounter

00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:28.300
a highly-intelligent enemy.

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:31.060
Today,

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:32.860
you get to see the result.

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:15.130
My dear teacher,

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:19.060
your move

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.020
is impressive.

00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:28.610
White Hair,

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:31.170
tell me.

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.740
What is your purpose in life?

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:37.340
If you are just doing it

00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:38.690
for the fleeting memories,

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.450
it's only natural for you to lose to me.

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:53.580
You

00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:56.780
want to dominate the world.

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.340
Isn't it because

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:05.100
you want to become

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:06.610
the slave masters

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:08.020
you killed back then?

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:14.130
You grow in the spring and harvest in the autumn.

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:17.260
Life and death are irreversible.

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:20.020
But the cycle of power struggles continues endlessly.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:28.930
As for you,

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.130
if you want to become a slave master,

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.170
you won't have a place to go.

00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:48.100
You're wrong.

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:57.780
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:00.170
Today,

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:03.060
I win.

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:19.500
Let's go.

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:25.860
Don't you want to see him take his last breath?

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:28.780
He is White Hair.

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:31.580
Right.

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:33.300
He is White Hair.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.260
His life has been full of hardship.

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:39.780
So,

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.100
he should die in this desolate place

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:45.410
with no one around him.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.300
No friends,

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:49.170
not even his enemies,

00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:51.610
will witness his end.

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:54.540
Hold on.

00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:58.170
I must bring back these lamb chops.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.610
I'll give them to my neighbors.

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:02.820
This is enough for them to have a feast tonight.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.020
You have nowhere to go

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:06.890
but I do.

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:10.260

I sensed a shiver down my spine.

Why?

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:48.340
Stop pretending.

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:50.220
If I had

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:53.100
killed White Hair a moment later inside,

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:54.810
you would've killed me.

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:00.540
White Hair

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.620
is more dangerous than Xiao Wuyang and Yan Fengshan.

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.620
He must die.

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:10.140
Because of that, I can kill anyone

00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:11.540
who stops me from killing him.

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:13.890
After the Liu family was wiped out,

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:17.620
you went missing for 15 years.

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:20.630
I had no choice but to be cautious of you.

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:23.260
I'm sure this is reasonable.

00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:31.300
Cen Pickles.

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.970
You made up stories about your neighbors

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:37.390
and even removed

00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:38.820
and drained the lamb

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:40.660
to stall time.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:45.660
You wanted to prove

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:47.530
that you didn't feel sorry for White Hair.

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:51.260
That was too pretentious.

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:54.800
I did it because I couldn't trust you completely.

00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.180
Luckily, I did it.

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:00.910
He is just

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:02.040
the son of an acquaintance

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:03.530
and the son of an enemy.

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:04.740
An unparalleled genius.

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:07.100
For your ambition,

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:09.260
he should die.

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:14.050
It's the ambition of the Tiemo people.

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:20.300
I didn't make up stories about my neighbors.

00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:23.780
I really want to bring the lamb back.

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.050
Those who are lazy

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:29.220
will usually

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:31.370
leech for free food at my place.

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:33.770
I even gave them nicknames.

00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:35.970
There's Gulouzi

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.740
and Gourd Chicken.

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:54.370
In this world,

00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:56.450
we need some bad friends.

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:16.050
White Hair is dead inside.

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:18.780
I need to bring back the lamb.

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:20.930
After tonight,

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:24.220
Chang'an will belong to you.

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:29.740
Tomorrow,

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.780
I'll bring some Huoshan Huangya tea.

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:33.450
What do you think?

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:34.970
Sure.

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:50.970
As for you,

00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:54.490
if you want to become a slave master,

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:00.660
you won't have a place to go.

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:05.930
You have nowhere to go but I do.

00:41:57.390 --> 00:41:58.050
He's completely dead?

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:00.010
Yes.

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:01.490
You got your wish.

00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:03.330
Drink tea and kill people.

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:05.890
Just like the person we admired.

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:08.660
Why did you come back?

00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:11.140
Our most worthy enemy is dead.

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.740
I'm worried that you might feel lonely.

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:15.970
Why not come with me?

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:22.490
There's lamb,

00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:23.780
pickles,

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:25.660
and premium tea.

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.220
It's much better than this place of yours.

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:29.660
You can't even light the stove here.

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:32.100
Huoshan Huangya tea?

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:38.890
Your residence

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:40.600
is just as I imagined.

00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:43.180
It's not that quiet.

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:45.490
The prison is quiet

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:46.620
but I can't stay there.

00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:51.530
If you don't mind,

00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:53.490
come and chat with me often.

00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:54.820
However,

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:56.890
you must first help me dry the pickles.

00:42:59.350 --> 00:42:59.860
Sure thing.

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:03.450
Two children of slaves

00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:05.530
who weren't eaten by wolves

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:09.050
experienced a chaotic period.

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:10.700
We met each other

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:12.820
after hiding for more than a decade.

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:16.010
We should spend days catching up.

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:18.930
We were just two children of slaves.

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:21.180
Neither of us would expect

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.090
that one day, we could live in Chang'an

00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:26.010
and decide the fate of this city.

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.740
I expected it.

00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:32.050
I've expected it since the day

00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:34.010
we picked up the blade.

00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:45.010
After so many years,

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:47.090
you have gotten old.

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.620
You are one to talk.

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:54.140
We should be old.

00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:55.490
If we are not,

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:56.930
we will become demons.

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:01.220
Do you know?

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:03.970
When I dream at night,

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:06.370
I usually see us when we were young

00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:09.140
with sheep in the grasslands

00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:10.700
and wolves.

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:13.140
They look at me, baring their white fangs.

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:15.930
I always wake up

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.010
in cold sweats.

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:20.000
Cen Pickles!

00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:21.970
Cen Pickles!

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:25.740
You're so rude.

00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:26.890
Call me Grandpa.

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:28.010
Cen Pickles!

00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:29.180
Your house has been robbed.

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:30.010
What?

00:44:30.830 --> 00:44:31.450
Gulouzi and the rest

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:33.820
took all your pickles and meat.

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.370
They said a war was coming

00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:36.140
and wanted to prevent food shortages.

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:49.050
My house was robbed. Forgive me for not hosting you.

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:51.890
Where did they take my food?

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:53.970
The granary over there!

00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:58.220
Are you going to beat them up?

00:44:58.280 --> 00:44:58.700
Yes!

00:44:58.910 --> 00:45:00.140
I'll beat them up badly!

00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:01.410
Bring me along!

00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:13.080
Don't kill them.

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:14.740
We just need to teach them a lesson.

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:16.090
Just teach them a lesson.

00:45:17.410 --> 00:45:18.180
Cen Pickles.

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:19.710
You are old.

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:20.820
You might lose.

00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:22.450
Let me lead the charge.

00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:23.660
I promise not to kill them.

00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:16.090
I have a big family and business.

00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:18.300
I must bring back these lamb chops.

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.530
I'll give them to my neighbors.

00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:22.890
This is enough for them to have a feast tonight.

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:25.340
Those who are lazy

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:26.970
will usually

00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:28.890
leech for free food at my place.

00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:30.480
I even gave them nicknames.

00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:32.870
There's Gulouzi

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:35.660
and Gourd Chicken.

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:37.490
In this world,

00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:39.530
we need some bad friends.

00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:52.530
Why did you give your neighbors

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:56.370
the names of our dead friends as their nicknames?

00:46:57.630 --> 00:46:59.530
I remember what White Hair said to me.

00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:02.770
He could kill Yan Fengshan

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:06.050
because he believes

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:08.930
he is someone who lives in a lie.

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.260
His younger sister is dead

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:14.660
but he can see his younger sister's spirit.

00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:18.370
All humans have a fatal weak spot.

00:47:19.390 --> 00:47:20.450
So, he came up with the idea

00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:23.660
of disguising an assassin as Yan Fengshan's adopted son

00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:26.340
to fake his son's revival

00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:30.970
and kill Yan Fengshan when he is

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:32.570
at his most vulnerable.

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:36.220
Killing someone by using their fatal weak spot.

00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:39.490
How exquisite.

00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:43.090
Yan Fengshan stood no chance.

00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:46.300
So do I.

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:48.370
Gulouzi

00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:49.780
and Gourd Chicken

00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:51.570
were dead.

00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:53.140
They have been dead for decades.

00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:56.490
I gave my neighbors these nicknames

00:47:58.640 --> 00:47:59.700
to lie to myself.

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.260
You are lying to me.

00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:05.570
White Hair told me

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:07.340
you'd never trust me.

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:09.530
The only way to solve this

00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:11.570
is to use his life

00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:12.820
as a lure.

00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:16.180
I've known you for more than 40 years.

00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:20.410
I've always seen you as a friend.

00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:22.180
We are friends but we are not walking the same path.

00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:24.210
You killed, too!

00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:25.260
I killed

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:27.140
so more people can live.

00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:28.300
You killed

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.570
because you want to become

00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:32.220
the slave masters we killed.

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:34.050
War ravaged Chang'an

00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:35.860
and dead bodies are everywhere.

00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:37.570
This isn't what I want.

00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:40.890
Cen Pickles!

00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:42.410
If I die,

00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:45.570
do you still

00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:49.300
have anywhere to go?

00:49:37.310 --> 00:49:38.660
White Hair sacrificed himself

00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:40.820
to achieve your goal.

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.180
Who are you?

00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:53.970
When do we act?

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:55.660
What is the signal?

00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:56.820
Tomorrow

00:49:57.950 --> 00:49:58.860
at the hour of Shen.
