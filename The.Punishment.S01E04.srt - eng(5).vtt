00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:26.630
keep an eye on him.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.630
Don't worry. I can keep him in check.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.050
Captain Zhong, take it easy.
Don't hurt yourself.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:48.910
Captain Zhong.

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:52.480
Thank you.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.910
You're in great shape.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.620
Here, Captain Zhong.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:56.260
Okay.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.140
Thank you.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.660
How does it feel

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.300
on your first day back?

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:10.370
The atmosphere at the Municipal Bureau

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:11.360
is really great.

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:13.360
We were just talking about it.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.550
I said, with such a good atmosphere,

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:16.940
you can tell at a glance it's a team
led by Captain Zhong.

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.400
Enough. Enough.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.170
S-Stop flattering me.

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:26.500
Qin.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.230
Since you're back now,

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.270
let me be frank with you.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.720
From now on,

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.980
you need to forget
those police station methods.

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:40.090
Yes.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.750
I want to make my position
clear to you, Captain Zhong.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:44.870
Although

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.180
Director Ye transferred me here,

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.390
since I'm in your department now

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.670
and under your command,

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.000
I'm your soldier.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.260
I'll go wherever you point me.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:55.750
I'll follow all your orders.

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:56.840
Good.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:58.990
With that commitment,

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.670
I'll be completely
straightforward with you.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:02.390
Come on.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:06.030
-Sit down. Let's sit down and talk.
-Thank you, Captain Zhong.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:10.550
Qin.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:13.240
What do you think

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.120
about the case
Captain Hu discussed

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.270
with you earlier?

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:22.400
Captain Zhong,

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.640
honestly, I haven't figured out

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:27.380
how to handle this case yet.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:29.840
Just tell me what you're thinking.

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:35.040
Actually, this case mainly depends on

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.440
the missing Wang Ming.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.140
But I checked before

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.820
and he was taken away
by two police officers.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.690
But there's something
complicated

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:44.650
about this.

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:45.980
Tell me about it.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:48.270
Captain Zhong.

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:49.230
How about this?

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.400
This case is indeed quite significant.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.260
I'll go back and investigate further.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.660
I'll report to you
as soon as I have results.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.170
Quite significant?

00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:59.390
How significant is it?

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:00.600
This case, well...

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:03.650
Keep your voice down.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:06.660
Well,

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.260
these two people...

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:09.290
They're fake police officers.

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:09.910
Yes.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.350
What's so secretive about that?

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.090
This is a very serious offense.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:17.050
How much evidence do you have?

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.310
We have some. Show it to Captain Zhong.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.960
Here, Captain Zhong.

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:30.220
Captain Zhong, you see—

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.150
even the badge numbers are fake.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.440
This matter must be
thoroughly investigated.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.440
-Yes.
-You need to take this seriously.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.300
Right, I'm investigating it now.

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:38.580
Well then.

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:41.430
I'll think about this carefully.

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:42.840
If you can

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:44.870
dig up more

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.390
valuable clues,

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:48.780
it'll be easier for me
to talk to the leadership.

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.840
-Thank you, Captain Zhong.
-You have to get to the bottom of it.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:51.800
Yes, we will.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:53.440
Okay. Alright.

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:55.270
I'll get back to work now.

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:57.070
Please go ahead, Captain Zhong.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:58.220
Okay.

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:04.720
I never noticed
when we were at the station

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.150
that you, with your honest face,

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:07.480
were so good
at providing emotional support.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.860
Are you managing up?

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.550
Managing up

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.390
is about the "up."

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.140
When I was at the station,
where was there any room to manage up?

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.930
Then later, give me
some emotional support

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:18.730
and manage me.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:19.990
You don't need it.

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:21.250
Why wouldn't I need it?

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.480
What if I become a captain one day?

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.200
Right?

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.820
The way you exercise now
is very captain-like.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:31.240
Sir.

Get me some tokens.

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:33.270
Coming.

Want more tokens?

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.810
You still owe me 80,000.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.840
So,

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.870
are you going to keep playing?

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.200
Stop talking and hurry up.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.390
Bring some tokens over.

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:48.360

Don't mention this to me.

He got locked up instead.

Tianfei?

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.510
Come with us.

he's here.

You're here, Tianfei.

What's going on?

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:23.960
If you have business, talk to my brother.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.290
Why are you grabbing me?

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:27.810
I don't owe you money.

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:31.840
How much does he owe you?

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:33.870
Mr. Luo, he's 80,000 short with me.

Go get 80,000.

I'll take it then.

Quite a temper you have.

want to pay you back.

That case ended tragically.

Xu Li couldn't take it
and committed suicide.

he was transferred to the police station.

Did they find the culprit?

They made a sketch back then,

but it was too vague to identify anyone.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.340
So the case was left unsolved.

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:23.140
That's why Mai fell out with Director Ye.

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:26.470

That's a tough one, Captain Qin.

They operate like guerrillas.

worry about anything else.

The dealer here is too... well,

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.500
how about getting
a pretty female dealer next time?

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:33.110
Well...

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:37.940
That's a good point.

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.270

Ye Siyuan causes no major troubles

to give him some leeway.

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:19.540
That means if we want to
keep Ye Tianyou stable,

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:22.040
this man is the key person.

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:25.510
We can try this approach.

Mr. Wang, let me report to you.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.080
After interacting
with this person, I found

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:34.740
he's arrogant

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:36.890
and completely unrealistic.

Alright, then I'll come to you

Sure, you can report to me as well.

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:50.050
It's better to resolve conflicts
than to create them.

Do you all remember?

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:55.510
This is where it happened back then.

If I could go back,

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:03.330

Don't worry, Mr. Qin,

but some people just wouldn't listen.

They had it coming.

Let's go, Tianye.

You go first. I'll sit for a while.

Why did you have me put on

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:31.850
this show today?

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:34.250
Ma Jin and Luo Bo

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.190
have stood unshaken
in Hanzhou for so many years.

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:37.920
There must be internal issues.

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:39.210
So I was thinking

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:40.000
that you

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.360
should infiltrate their organization.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.150
Alright.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.680
I'll do whatever you say.

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:48.800
It's fine, Tianye.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:49.330
I'm fine.

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:51.400
When dealing with someone like Luo Bo,

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:53.550
you need to be careful with boundaries.

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:54.110
I know.

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:56.250
They just want to use me

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:58.120
and make me betray Longwan.

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:02.170
So what should I do next?

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:03.550
You...

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:07.670
First, you need to prove
your loyalty to them.

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:09.530
So he and Ma Jin can trust you.

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:12.320
Then we can help your third brother
take him down.

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:14.280
But...

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:16.070
I want to use Luo Bo's help

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.800
to bring Zhao Village to our side.

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:23.320
How?

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:25.760
Zhao Peng's son, Zhao Wenxuan.

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:26.960
We'll start with him.

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.320
What does he have to do with this?

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:31.040
You'll

00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:33.230
tell Luo Bo you've come up with an idea.

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:34.200
Get Zhao Wenxuan

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:36.450
to poison our farm.

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.230
Zhao Peng loves his son
more than anything.

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:46.000
Would he actually let his son
fall into Longwan's hands?

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.150
Their whole village
will deliberately come make trouble.

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:51.150
That will prove the two villages
can't work together.

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:55.960
Isn't that too high a price to pay
for this gesture of loyalty?

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:56.760
Is it worth it?

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:57.640
It's worth it.

00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:58.900
This way,

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:01.070
Luo Bo will think
he's cut off our livelihood.

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:02.360
But he would never expect

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:04.630
that I'll eventually return Zhao Wenxuan.

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:06.670
I not only want you
to gain Luo Bo's trust,

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:07.740
but also to bring me

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:09.160
closer to Zhao Peng.

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:11.480
Tianye.

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:15.880

[House of Benevolence]

Zhao Wenxuan to poison our farm.

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.970
I want to report something.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.240
Longwan Farming Company

has major food safety issues

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:31.870
that must be thoroughly investigated.

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:33.150
Yes.

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:36.260
Well,

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:37.440
Tianye,

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:39.310
aren't you...

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:41.840
Being too ruthless?

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:44.830
Without a point of no return,

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:46.160
